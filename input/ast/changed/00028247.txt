     * Treat consecutive "packets" as if they are a continuous buffer.
     *
     * Say you have a 16-byte plaintext $plaintext.  Using the default behavior, the two following code snippets
     * will yield different outputs:
     *
     * <code>
     *    echo $des->encrypt(substr($plaintext, 0, 8));
     *    echo $des->encrypt(substr($plaintext, 8, 8));
     * </code>
     * <code>
     *    echo $des->encrypt($plaintext);
     * </code>
     *
     * The solution is to enable the continuous buffer.  Although this will resolve the above discrepancy, it creates
     * another, as demonstrated with the following:
     *
     * <code>
     *    $des->encrypt(substr($plaintext, 0, 8));
     *    echo $des->decrypt($des->encrypt(substr($plaintext, 8, 8)));
     * </code>
     * <code>
     *    echo $des->decrypt($des->encrypt(substr($plaintext, 8, 8)));
     * </code>
     *
     * With the continuous buffer disabled, these would yield the same output.  With it enabled, they yield different
     * outputs.  The reason is due to the fact that the initialization vector's change after every encryption /
     * decryption round when the continuous buffer is enabled.  When it's disabled, they remain constant.
     *
     * Put another way, when the continuous buffer is enabled, the state of the Crypt_DES() object changes after each
     * encryption / decryption round, whereas otherwise, it'd remain constant.  For this reason, it's recommended that
     * continuous buffers not be used.  They do offer better security and are, in fact, sometimes required (SSH uses them),
     * however, they are also less intuitive and more likely to cause you problems.

     * Treat consecutive "packets" as if they are a continuous buffer.
     *
     * Say you have a 16-byte plaintext $plaintext.  Using the default behavior, the two following code snippets
     * will yield different outputs:
     *
     * <code>
     *    echo $des->encrypt(substr($plaintext, 0, 8));
     *    echo $des->encrypt(substr($plaintext, 8, 8));
     * </code>
     * <code>
     *    echo $des->encrypt($plaintext);
     * </code>
     *
     * The solution is to enable the continuous buffer.  Although this will resolve the above discrepancy, it creates
     * another, as demonstrated with the following:
     *
     * <code>
     *    $des->encrypt(substr($plaintext, 0, 8));
     *    echo $des->decrypt($des->encrypt(substr($plaintext, 8, 8)));
     * </code>
     * <code>
     *    echo $des->decrypt($des->encrypt(substr($plaintext, 8, 8)));
     * </code>
     *
     * With the continuous buffer disabled, these would yield the same output.  With it enabled, they yield different
     * outputs.  The reason is due to the fact that the initialization vector's change after every encryption /
     * decryption round when the continuous buffer is enabled.  When it's disabled, they remain constant.
     *
     * Put another way, when the continuous buffer is enabled, the state of the Crypt_DES() object changes after each
     * encryption / decryption round, whereas otherwise, it'd remain constant.  For this reason, it's recommended that
     * continuous buffers not be used.  They do offer better security and are, in fact, sometimes required (SSH uses them),
     * however, they are also less intuitive and more likely to cause you problems.
     *
