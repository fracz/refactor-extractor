     * This function checks to see if the user is assuming another role by means of
     * role switching. In doing this we compare each RSW key (context path) against
     * the current context path. This ensures that we can provide the switching
     * options against both the course and any page shown under the course.
     *
     * @return bool|int The role(int) if the user is in another role, false otherwise
