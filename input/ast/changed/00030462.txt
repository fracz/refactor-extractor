     * If the value you want to save for your dimension is something like a page title or page url, you usually do not
     * want to save the raw value over and over again to save bytes in the database. Instead you want to save each value
     * once in the log_action table and refer to this value by its ID in the log_link_visit_action table. You can do
     * this by returning an action id in "getActionId()" and by returning a value here. If a value should be ignored
     * or not persisted just return boolean false. Please note if you return a value here and you implement the event
     * "onNewAction" the value will be probably overwritten by the other event. So make sure to implement only one of
     * those.
