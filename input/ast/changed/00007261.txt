	 *        converted into a physical file path and read.
	 * @param array $lines The array of lines to read. If a given line is not present in the data,
	 *        it will be silently ignored.
	 * @return array Returns an array where the keys are matching `$lines`, and the values are the

	 * @todo Add an $options parameter with a 'context' flag, to pull in n lines of context.
