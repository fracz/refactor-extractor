	 * Extract info from a PNG image with alpha channel using the Imagick or GD library.
	 * @param $file (string) Name of the file containing the image.
	 * @param $x (float) Abscissa of the upper-left corner.
	 * @param $y (float) Ordinate of the upper-left corner.
	 * @param $wpx (float) Original width of the image in pixels.
	 * @param $hpx (float) original height of the image in pixels.
	 * @param $w (float) Width of the image in the page. If not specified or equal to zero, it is automatically calculated.
	 * @param $h (float) Height of the image in the page. If not specified or equal to zero, it is automatically calculated.
	 * @param $type (string) Image format. Possible values are (case insensitive): JPEG and PNG (whitout GD library) and all images supported by GD: GD, GD2, GD2PART, GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, XBM, XPM;. If not specified, the type is inferred from the file extension.
	 * @param $link (mixed) URL or identifier returned by AddLink().
	 * @param $align (string) Indicates the alignment of the pointer next to image insertion relative to image height. The value can be:<ul><li>T: top-right for LTR or top-left for RTL</li><li>M: middle-right for LTR or middle-left for RTL</li><li>B: bottom-right for LTR or bottom-left for RTL</li><li>N: next line</li></ul>
	 * @param $resize (boolean) If true resize (reduce) the image to fit $w and $h (requires GD library).
	 * @param $dpi (int) dot-per-inch resolution used on resize
	 * @param $palign (string) Allows to center or align the image on the current line. Possible values are:<ul><li>L : left align</li><li>C : center</li><li>R : right align</li><li>'' : empty string : left for LTR or right for RTL</li></ul>
	 * @param $filehash (string) File hash used to build unique file names.
