   * explicitly asked for them, i.e. resulting from the user clicking
   * "show more"). The $mask returned is a sparesely populated dictionary

   * This function calculates a lot of stuff we need to know to display

   *
   * Gaps - compute gaps in the visible display diff, where we will render
   * "Show more context" spacers. If a gap is smaller than the context size,
   * we just display it. Otherwise, we record it into $gaps and will render a
   * "show more context" element instead of diff text below. A given $gap
   * is a tuple of $gap_line_number_start and $gap_length.
   *
   * Mask - compute the actual lines that need to be shown (because they
   * are near changes lines, near inline comments, or the request has
   * explicitly asked for them, i.e. resulting from the user clicking
   * "show more"). The $mask returned is a sparesely populated dictionary
   * of $visible_line_number => true.
   *
   * Depths - compute how indented any given line is. The $depths returned
   * is a sparesely populated dictionary of $visible_line_number => $depth.
   *
   * This function also has the side effect of modifying member variable
   * new such that tabs are normalized to spaces for each line of the diff.
