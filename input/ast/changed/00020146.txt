    /**
     * Background colour tests.
     *
     * When testing background styles it is important to understand how the background shorthand works.
     * background shorthand allows the following styles to be specified in a single "background" declaration:
     *   - background-color
     *   - background-image
     *   - background-repeat
     *   - background-attachment
     *   - background-position
     *
     * If the background shorthand is used it can contain one or more of those (preferabbly in that order).
     * Important it does not need to contain all of them.
     * However even if it doesn't contain values for all styles all of the styles will be affected.
     * If a style is missed from the shorthand background style but has an existing value in the rule then the existing value
     * is cleared.
     *
     * For example:
     *      .test {background: url(\'test.png\');background: bottom right;background:#123456;}
     * will result in:
     *      .test {background:#123456;}
     *
     * And:
     *      .test {background-image: url(\'test.png\');background:#123456;}
     * will result in:
     *      .test {background:#123456;}
