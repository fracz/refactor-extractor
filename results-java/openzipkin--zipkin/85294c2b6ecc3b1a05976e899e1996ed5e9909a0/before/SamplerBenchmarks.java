/**
 * <p>Zipkin v1 uses before-the-fact sampling. This means that the decision to keep or drop the
 * trace is made before any work is measured, or annotations are added. As such, the input parameter
 * to zipkin v1 samplers is the trace id (64-bit random number).
 *
 * <p>This only tests performance of various approaches against each-other. This doesn't test if the
 * same trace id is consistently sampled or not, or how close to the retention percentage the
 * samplers get.
 *
 * <p>While random sampling gives a better statistical average across all spans, it's less useful
 * than the ability to see end to end interrelated work, such as a from a specific user, or messages
 * blocking others in a queue. More sampling patterns are expected in OpenTracing and Zipkin v2.
