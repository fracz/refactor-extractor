/**
 * A trace is a series of spans (often RPC calls) which form a latency tree.
 *
 * <p/>Spans are usually created by instrumentation in RPC clients or servers, but can also
 * represent in-process activity. Annotations in spans are similar to log statements, and are
 * sometimes created directly by application developers to indicate events of interest, such as a
 * cache miss.
 *
 * <p/>The root span is where {@link #parentId} is null; it usually has the longest {@link #duration} in the
 * trace.
 *
 * <p/>Span identifiers are packed into longs, but should be treated opaquely. String encoding is
 * fixed-width lower-hex, to avoid signed interpretation.
