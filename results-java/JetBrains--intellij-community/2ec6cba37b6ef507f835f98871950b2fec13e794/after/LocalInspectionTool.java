 * Implement this abstract class in order to provide new inspection tool functionality. The major API limitation here is
 * subclasses should be stateless. Thus <code>check&lt;XXX&gt;</code> methods will be called in no particular order and
 * instances of this class provided by {@link InspectionToolProvider#getInspectionClasses()} will be created on demand.
 * The other important thing is problem anchors (PsiElements) reported by <code>check&lt;XXX&gt;</code> methods should
 * lie under corresponding first parameter of one method.
