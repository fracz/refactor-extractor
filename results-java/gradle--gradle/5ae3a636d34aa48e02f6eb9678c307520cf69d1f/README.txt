    GRADLE-1758 Improvements in the parallel builds feature after exposing some issues when running full daemon suite. The current strategy is as follows: connector.connect() does not guarantee to return an idle daemon (although there's a great chance for that). The daemon server itself controls what type of jobs he can do. He can do max 2 parallel jobs. One for the Build request. Second for eventual Stop request. If the build command is currently running and some unlucky client sends a build request to that daemon, the client receives Busy response and can try to connect to a different daemon.  There're number of refactorings I want to do with this code yet. I need this commit to regroup after a bloody battle with with the daemon paralellization.
