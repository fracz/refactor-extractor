/**
 * <p>A <code>DependencyManager</code> represents the set of dependencies and artifacts for a {@link
 * org.gradle.api.Project}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Using the DependencyManager in a Build File</h3>
 *
 * <h4>Dynamic Properties</h4>
 *
 * <p>Each configuration added to this {@code DependencyManager} is made available as a property which can be used from
 * your build script. You use the name of the configuration as the property name to refer to the {@link Configuration}
 * object.</p>
 *
 * <h4>Dynamic Methods</h4>
 *
 * <p>The following methods are added for each configuration added to this {@code DependencyManager}. For a
 * configuration with name {@code config}:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>Method {@code config(Closure configureClosure)}. This is equivalent to calling {@link #configuration(String,
 * groovy.lang.Closure)}.</li>
 *
 * <li>Method {@code config(Object dependency,Closure configureClosure)}. This is equivalent to calling {@link
 * #dependency(java.util.List, Object, groovy.lang.Closure)}.</li>
 *
 * <li>Method {@code config(Object... dependencies)}. This is equivalent to calling
 * {@link #dependencies(java.util.List, Object[])}.</li>
