/**
 * Executes a Gradle build, allowing inspection of the outcome.
 * <p>
 * A Gradle runner can be used to functionally test build logic, by executing a contrived build.
 * Assertions can then be made on the outcome of the build, such as the state of files created by the build,
 * or what tasks were actually executed during the build.
 * <p>
 * A runner can be created via the {@link #create()} method.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #withArguments(String...)} method allows the build arguments to be specified,
 * just as they would be on the command line.
 * The {@link #build()} method can be used to invoke the build when it is expected to succeed,
 * while the {@link #buildAndFail()} method can be used when the build is expected to fail.
 * <p>
 * GradleRunner instances are not thread safe and cannot be used concurrently.
 * However, multiple instances are able to be used concurrently.
 * <p>
 * Further aspects of the build are also able to be configured.
 * <p>
 * Please see <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/test_kit.html">the Gradle TestKit User Guide chapter</a> for more information.
