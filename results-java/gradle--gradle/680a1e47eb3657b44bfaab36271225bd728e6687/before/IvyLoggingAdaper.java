/**
 * This class is for integrating Ivy log statements into our logging system. We don't want to have a dependency on logback.
 * This would be bad for embedded usage. We only want one on slf4j. But slf4j has no constants for log levels. As we
 * want to avoid the execution of if statements for each Ivy request, we use Map which delegates Ivy log statements to
 * Sl4j action classes.
