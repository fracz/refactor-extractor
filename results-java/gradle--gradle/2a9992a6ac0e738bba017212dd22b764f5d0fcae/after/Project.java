/**
 * This interface is the main API you use to interact with Gradle from your build file. From a <code>Project</code>, you
 * can programmatically access all Gradle's features.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
 *
 * <p>There is a one-to-one relationship between a <code>Project</code> and a <code>{@value #DEFAULT_BUILD_FILE}</code>
 * file. During build initialisation, Gradle assembles a <code>Project</code> object for each project which is to
 * participate in the build, as follows:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>Create a {@link Settings} instance for the build.</li>
 *
 * <li>Evaluate the <code>{@value org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings#DEFAULT_SETTINGS_FILE}</code> script, if
 * present, against the {@link Settings} object to configure it.</li>
 *
 * <li>Use the configured {@link Settings} object to create the hierarchy of <code>Project</code> instances.</li>
 *
 * <li>Finally, evaluate each <code>Project</code> by executing its <code>{@value #DEFAULT_BUILD_FILE}</code> file, if
 * present, against the project. The project are evaulated in breadth-wise order, such that a project is evaulated
 * before its child projects. This order can be overridden by adding an evaluation dependency.</p>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Tasks</h3>
 *
 * <p>A project is essentially a collection of {@link Task} objects. Each task performs some basic piece of work, such
 * as compiling classes, or running unit tests, or zipping up a WAR file. You add tasks to a project using one of the
 * {@code add()} methods on {@link TaskContainer}, such as {@link TaskContainer#add(String)}.  You can locate existing
 * tasks using one of the lookup methods on {@link TaskContainer}, such as {@link TaskContainer#getByName(String)}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Dependencies</h3>
 *
 * <p>A project generally has a number of dependencies it needs in order to do its work.  Also, a project generally
 * produces a number of artifacts, which other projects can use. Those dependencies are grouped in configurations, and
 * can be retrieved and uploaded from repositories. You use the {@link org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.ConfigurationHandler}
 * returned by {@link #getConfigurations()} ()} method to manage the configurations. The {@link
 * org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler} returned by {@link #getDependencies()} method to manage the
 * dependencies. The {@link org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.ArtifactHandler} returned by {@link #getArtifacts()} ()} method
 * to manage the artifacts. The {@link org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.RepositoryHandler} returned by {@link
 * #getRepositories()} ()} method to manage the repositories.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Multi-project Builds</h3>
 *
 * <p>Projects are arranged into a hierarchy of projects. A project has a name, and a fully qualified path which
 * uniquely identifies it in the hierarchy.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Using a Project in a Build File</h3>
 *
 * <p>Gradle executes the project's build file against the <code>Project</code> instance to configure the project. Any
 * property or method which your script uses which is not defined in the script is delegated through to the associated
 * <code>Project</code> object.  This means, that you can use any of the methods and properties on the
 * <code>Project</code> interface directly in your script.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example:
 * <pre>
 * createTask('some-task')  // Delegates to Project.createTask()
 * reportDir = file('reports') // Delegates to Project.file() and Project.setProperty()
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>You can also access the <code>Project</code> instance using the <code>project</code> property. This can make the
 * script clearer in some cases. For example, you could use <code>project.name</code> rather than <code>name</code> to
 * access the project's name.</p>
 *
 * <a name="properties"/> <h4>Dynamic Properties</h4>
 *
 * <p>A project has 5 property 'scopes', which it searches for properties. You can access these properties by name in
 * your build file, or by calling the project's {@link #property(String)} method. The scopes are:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>The <code>Project</code> object itself. This scope includes any property getters and setters declared by the
 * <code>Project</code> implementation class.  For example, {@link #getRootProject()} is accessable as the
 * <code>rootProject</code> property.  The properties of this scope are readable or writable depending on the presence
 * of the corresponding getter or setter method.</li>
 *
 * <li>The <em>additional</em> properties of the project.  Each project maintains a map of additional properties, which
 * can contain any arbitrary name -> value pair.  The properties of this scope are readable and writable.</li>
 *
 * <li>The <em>convention</em> properties added to the project by each {@link Plugin} applied to the project. A {@link
 * Plugin} can add properties and methods to a project through the project's {@link Convention} object.  The properties
 * of this scope may be readable or writable, depending on the convention objects.</li>
 *
 * <li>The tasks of the project.  A task is accessable by using its name as a property name.  The properties of this
 * scope are read-only. For example, a task called <code>compile</code> is accessable as the <code>compile</code>
 * property.</li>
 *
 * <li>The additional properties and convention properties of the project's parent project, recursively up to the root
 * project. The properties of this scope are read-only.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When reading a property, the project searches the above scopes in order, and returns the value from the first
 * scope it finds the property in.  See {@link #property(String)} for more details.</p>
 *
 * <p>When writing a property, the project searches the above scopes in order, and sets the property in the first scope
 * it finds the property in.  If not found, the project adds the property to its map of additional properties. See
 * {@link #setProperty(String, Object)} for more details.</p>
 *
 * <h4>Dynamic Methods</h4>
 *
 * <p>A project has 5 method 'scopes', which it searches for methods:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>The <code>Project</code> object itself.</li>
 *
 * <li>The build file.  The project searches for a matching method declared in the build file.</li>
 *
 * <li>The <em>convention</em> methods added to the project by each {@link Plugin} applied to the project. A {@link
 * Plugin} can add properties and method to a project through the project's {@link Convention} object.</li>
 *
 * <li>The tasks of the project. A method is added for each task, using the name of the task as the method name and
 * taking a single closure parameter. The method calls the {@link Task#configure(groovy.lang.Closure)} method for the
 * associated task with the provided closure. For example, if the project has a task called <code>compile</code>, then a
 * method is added with the following signature: <code>void compile(Closure configureClosure)</code>.</li>
 *
 * <li>The parent project, recursively up to the root project.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
