    Improve the error output when there are unbound model rules.

    For some definition of “improve”.
    The new output provides all the necessary info to understand what happened, but will make little sense to someone who doesn't understand the basics of model rules.

    More stories have been added to improve the “experience” for different types of users when there are unbound rules.
