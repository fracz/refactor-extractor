/**
 * The client piece of the build daemon.
 * <p>
 * Immediately upon forming a connection, the daemon may send {@link OutputEvent} messages back to the client and may do so
 * for as long as the connection is open.
 * <p>
 * The client is expected to send exactly one {@link Build} message as the first message it sends to the daemon. The daemon
 * may either return {@link DaemonBusy} or {@link BuildStarted}. If the former is received, the client should not send any more
 * messages to this daemon. If the latter is received, the client can assume the daemon is performing the build. The client may then
 * send zero to many {@link ForwardInput} messages. If the client's stdin stream is closed before the connection to the
 * daemon is terminated, the client must send a {@link CloseInput} command to instruct the daemon that no more input is to be
 * expected.
 * <p>
 * After receiving the {@link Result} message (after a {@link BuildStarted} mesage), the client must send a {@link CloseInput}
 * command if it has not already done so due to the stdin stream being closed. At this point the client is expected to
 * terminate the connection with the daemon.
 * <p>
 * If the daemon returns a {@code null} message before returning a {@link Result} object, it has terminated unexpectedly for some reason.
