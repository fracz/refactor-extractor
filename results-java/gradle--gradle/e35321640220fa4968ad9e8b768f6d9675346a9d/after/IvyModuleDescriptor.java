     * Returns a read-only map of the extra info declared in this descriptor.
     * The extra info is the set of all non-standard subelements of the <em>info</em> element.
     * For each such element, the returned map contains one entry. The entry's key is the name
     * (i.e. tag) of the element, including any namespace prefix. The entry's value is the contents of
     * the element.
     *
     * Example: Given an <em>info</em> element with the following non-standard subelements:
     *
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * &lt;info&gt;
     *     &lt;ns1:expires&gt;2015-09-23&lt;/ns1:expires&gt;

     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     *
     * Then the returned map will be {@code ["ns1:expires": "2015-09-23", "ns2:popularity": "high"]}.
