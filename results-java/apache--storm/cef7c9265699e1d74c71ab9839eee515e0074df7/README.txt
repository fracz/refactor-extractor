    STORM-2666: Fix storm-kafka-client spout sometimes emitting messages that were already committed. Expand tests, add some runtime validation, minor refactoring to increase code readability. Ensure OffsetManager commits as many offsets as possible when an offset void (deleted offsets) occurs, rather than just up to the gap.
