/**
 * A relationship's type, which is a mandatory property on all relationships
 * that is used for navigating the node space. RelationshipType is in particular
 * a key part of the {@link Traverser traverser framework} but it's also used in
 * various {@link Node#getRelationships() relationship operations} on Node.
 * <p>
 * Relationship types are declared by the client and can be handled either
 * dynamically or statically in a Neo-based application. Internally,
 * relationship types are dynamic. This means that every time a client invokes
 * {@link Node#createRelationshipTo(Node,RelationshipType)
 * node.createRelationshipTo(anotherNode, newRelType)} and passes in a new
 * relationship type then the new type will be transparently created.
 * <p>
 * However, in case the application does not need to dynamically create
 * relationship types (most don't), then it's nice to have the compile-time
 * benefits of a static set of relationship types. Fortunately, RelationshipType
 * is designed to work well with Java 5 enums. This means that it's very easy to
 * define a set of valid relationship types by declaring an enum that implements
 * RelationshipType and then reuse that across the application. For example,
 * here's how you would define an enum to hold all your relationship types:
 * <code><pre>
 * enum MyRelationshipTypes implements RelationshipType
 * {
 *     CONTAINED_IN, KNOWS
 * }
 * </pre></code> Then later, it's as easy to use as: <code><pre>
 * node.createRelationshipTo( anotherNode, MyRelationshipTypes.KNOWS );
 * for ( Relationship rel : node.getRelationships( MyRelationshipTypes.KNOWS ) )
 * {
 * 	// ...
 * }
 * </pre></code> Please note that in early 1.0 betas, you were required to supply an
 * enum of RelationshipTypes to the {@link EmbeddedNeo} constructor, or register
 * valid relationship types. This is no longer needed.
 * <p>
 * It's very important to note that a relationship type is uniquely identified
 * by its name, not by any particular instance that implements this interface.
 * This means that the proper way to check if two relationship types are equal
 * is by invoking <code>equals()</code> on their {@link #name names}, NOT by
 * using Java's identity operator (<code>==</code>). However, you usually
 * want to check whether a specific relationship <i>instance</i> is of a
 * certain type and that is best done with the
 * {@link Relationship#isType Relationship.isType} method, such as:
 * <code><pre>
 *  if ( rel.isType( MyRelationshipTypes.CONTAINED_IN ) )
 * {
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre></code>
