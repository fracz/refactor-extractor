/**
 * Iterable whose {@link ResourceIterator iterators} have associated resources
 * that must be managed.
 *
 * This interface is similar to { @link Iterable } but adds additional
 * functionality to ensure that resources can be released.
 *
 * If you intend to exhaust the returned iterators, you can use conventional
 * code aas you would with a normal Iterable:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * ResourceIterable<Object> iterable;
 * for ( Object item : iterable )
 * {
 *     ...
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * However, if your code might not exhaust the iterator, you should ensure that
 * you call close on the iterator, using a finally block or try-with-resources.
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * ResourceIterable<Object> iterable;
 * ResourceIterator<Object> iterator = iterable.iterator();
 * try
 * {
 *     while ( iterator.hasNext() )
 *     {
 *         Object item = iterator.next();
 *         if ( ... )
 *         {
 *             return item; // iterator may not be exhausted.
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * finally
 * {
 *     iterator.close();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of values returned through the iterators.
