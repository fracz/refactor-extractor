/**
 * In order to make the solving of shortest path problems as general as
 * possible, the algorithms accept objects handling all relevant tasks regarding
 * costs of paths. This allows the user to represent the costs in any possible
 * way, and to calculate them in any way. The usual case is numbers that we just
 * add together, but what if we have for example factors we would like to
 * multiply instead? This is handled by this system, which works as follows. A
 * CostEvaluator is used to get the cost for a single relationship. These costs
 * are then added through a CostAccumulator. Costs for alternative paths are
 * compared with a common java.util.Comparator.
