/**
 * Helps you with a test harness for running concurrent load. Specify the number of concurrent workers,
 * and a worker method to be executed. You can also, of course, optionally override setUp and tearDown methods
 * to set up context that should be available to all workers. Make sure to call setUp and tearDown super methods
 * if you do override those.
 *
 * In order to give workers access to things that you set up and tear down, use the WorkerContext that is available
 * via getContext().
 *
 * Each worker is expected to time it's own operations and return a set of metrics, those metrics are then combined into
 * totals.
