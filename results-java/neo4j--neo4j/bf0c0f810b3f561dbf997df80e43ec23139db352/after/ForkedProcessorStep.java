/**
 * Executes batches sequentially, one at a time, although running multiple processing threads on each batch.
 * This is almost the opposite of {@link ProcessorStep} which has ability of running multiple batches in parallel,
 * each batch processed by one thread.
 *
 * The purpose of this type of step is to much better be able to parallelize steps that are seen to be
 * bottlenecks, but are generally very hard to figure out how to parallelize.
 *
 * Extending {@link ProcessorStep} and providing max processors 1, i.e. always single-threaded, i.e. only
 * max one batch being processed at any given point in time. This thread instead starts its own army of
 * internal "forked" processors which will sit and wait for notifications to start processing the next batch.
