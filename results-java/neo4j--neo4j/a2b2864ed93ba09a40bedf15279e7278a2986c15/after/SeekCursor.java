/**
 * {@link RawCursor} over tree leaves, making keys/values accessible to user. Given a starting leaf
 * and key range this cursor traverses each leaf and its right siblings as long as visited keys are within
 * key range. Each visited key within the key range can be accessible using {@link #get()}.
 * The key/value instances provided by {@link Hit} instance are mutable and overwritten with new values
 * for every call to {@link #next()} so user cannot keep references to key/value instances, expecting them
 * to keep their values intact.
 * <p>
 * Concurrent writes can happen in the visited nodes and tree structure may change. This implementation
 * guards for that by re-reading if change happens underneath, but will not provide a consistent view of
 * the data as it were when the seek starts, i.e. doesn't support MVCC-style.
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: there are assumptions that keys are unique in the tree.
