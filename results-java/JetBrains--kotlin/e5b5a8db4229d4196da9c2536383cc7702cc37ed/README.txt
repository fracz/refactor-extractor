    Rollback partially a commit that dropped removePerfOutput functionality, fixes CompilerDaemonTest.testHelloApp

    The commit was done by @yole in assumption that the function only affects PARF lines generated by compiler, but similar lines generated
    by daemon infrastructure were affected as well, the mentioned test was failing since. CliBaseTest class was refactored, I place the removePerfOutput
    function into AbstractCliTest class.
