/**
 * This method returns an {@link HttpClientRequest} instance which represents an HTTP CONNECT request with the specified {@code uri}.<p>
 * When an HTTP response is received from the server the {@code responseHandler} is called passing in the response.
 *
 * Because of the nature of CONNECT the connection is automatically upgraded to raw TCP if a response code of 200 is received from the
 * remote peer. In this case you are able to get hold of the raw TCP socket via calling {@link HttpClientResponse#netSocket()}.
