    Query Refactoring: remove deprecated methods and temporary classes

    After all queries now have a `toQuery` method and the parsers all
    support `fromXContent` it is possible to remove the following
    workarounds and deprecated methods we kept around while doing the
    refactoring:

    * remove the BaseQueryParser and BaseQueryParserTemp. All parsers
      implement QueryParser directly now
    * remove deprecated methods in QueryParseContext that either returned
      a Query or a Filter.
    * remove the temporary QueryWrapperQueryBuilder

    Relates to #10217
