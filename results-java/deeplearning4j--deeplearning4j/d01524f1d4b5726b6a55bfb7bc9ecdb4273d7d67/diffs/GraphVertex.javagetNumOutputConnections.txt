int getNumOutputConnections();||||||||/**
 * Get the number of outgoing connections from this GraphVertex. A GraphVertex may only have a single output (for
 * example, the activations out of a layer), but this output may be used as the input to an arbitrary number of other
 * GraphVertex instances. This method returns the number of GraphVertex instances the output of this GraphVertex is input for.
