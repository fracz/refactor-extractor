 * SparkTrainingStats is an interface that is used for accessing training statistics, for multiple {@link org.deeplearning4j.spark.api.TrainingMaster}
 * implementations.
 *
 * The idea is that for debugging purposes, we want to collect a number of statistics related to the training. However, these
 * statistics will vary, depending on which the type of training we are doing. Specifically, both the keys (number of stats)
 * and their actual values (types/classes) can vary.
 *
 * The interface here operates essentially as a {@code Map<String,Object>}
