    Fix exceptions thrown by ShadowSQLiteConnection (#2434)

    In addition to making the exceptions thrown match those thrown from
    android, this CL improves the stack traces - all exceptions thrown
    include the ExecutionException in them, which shows the real invocation
    site of the command throwing the exception, not just the stack trace of
    ShadowSQLiteConnectionâ€™s internal executor.

    Also, interrupting the thread making a call to the database no longer
    results in an exception.
