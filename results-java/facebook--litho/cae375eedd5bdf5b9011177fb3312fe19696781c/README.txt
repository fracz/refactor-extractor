    Initial boilerplate for TestSpec generation

    Summary:
    This is some of the initial boilerplate for generating `TestSpec`s. I am going
    for an incremental approach for landing this which will include a bunch of
    unfinished and frankly useless code and will refactor along the way.

    Please still feel free to point out rough corners in the reviews. I want to make
    sure to at least leave TODOs in the relevant places.
