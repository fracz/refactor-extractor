/**
 * {@code MissingBackpressureException} indicates that a Subscriber or operator attempted to apply reactive pull
 * backpressure to an Observable that does not implement it.
 * <p>
 * If an Observable has not been written to support reactive pull backpressure (such support is not a
 * requirement for Observables), you can apply one of the following operators to it, each of which forces a
 * simple form of backpressure behavior:
 * <dl>
 *  <dt><code>onBackpressureBuffer</code></dt>
 *   <dd>maintains a buffer of all emissions from the source Observable and emits them to downstream Subscribers
 *       according to the requests they generate</dd>
 *  <dt><code>onBackpressureDrop</code></dt>
 *   <dd>drops emissions from the source Observable unless there is a pending request from a downstream
 *       Subscriber, in which case it will emit enough items to fulfill the request</dd>
 * </dl>
 * If you do not apply either of these operators to an Observable that does not support backpressure, and if
 * either you as the Subscriber or some operator between you and the Observable attempts to apply reactive pull
 * backpressure, you will encounter a {@code MissingBackpressureException} which you will be notified of via
 * your {@code onError} callback.
