    Openshift connector improvements (#5052)

    * CHE-4141 - Use Persistent Volumes Claims when creating workspaces

    Signed-off-by: Snjezana Peco <snjezana.peco@redhat.com>

    * Implement getContainerLogs method in OpenShiftConnector

    Signed-off-by: Snjezana Peco <snjezana.peco@redhat.com>

    * Implement createExec() and startExec() in OpenShiftConnector

    Add implementations of createExec() and startExec(). Since OpenShift
    does not separate the create and start steps, a holder class
    KubernetesExecHolder is necessary, to pass information between
    the call to createExec() (which just saves relevant information)
    and startExec().

    Additionally, adds KubernetesOutputAdapter, which parses the output
    from OpenShift into LogMessages that can be handled by Che's
    MessageProcessor<LogMessage> class.

    * Che server and workpaces exposed on the same single TCP port (#4351)

    * Disabling usage of user account service in openshift-connector

    Signed-off-by: Sun Seng David Tan <sutan@redhat.com>

    * Update Docker Compose tests to fix test failure

    Updating to Jackson 2.7.7 causes tests in the docker compose
    plugin to fail. This is due to the fact that the tests expect
    empty values in dictionaries to be parsed as the empty string,
    whereas jackson 2.7.7 parses them as null (as specified by the
    yaml spec).

    Modifies the affected tests to explicitly use an empty string
    (i.e. "") instead of an empty value.

    * Find an alternative to subPath in volumeMount

    * Setting rwx permissions for all on /data/ in case it's not mounted

    Signed-off-by: Mario Loriedo <mloriedo@redhat.com>

    * Add support for resource limits when running on Openshift

    Add resource limits to workspace Pods when running on OpenShift.
    The memory limit is normally obtained from the API request to
    create the workspace, however it can be overridden via the property
    `che.openshift.workspace.memory.override`. The cpu limit used is
    determined by the property `che.openshift.workspace.cpu.limit`.

    In both cases, the value of the property is passed directly to
    OpenShift, so any valid quantity is acceptable (e.g. 150Mi,
    1Gi, 1024, etc).

    * Fix dockerImageConfig is null (since v1.5 of OpenShift API)

    Signed-off-by: Sun Seng David Tan <sutan@redhat.com>

    * Add Nullable annotation to che.docker.ip.external

    The property che.docker.ip.external can be null, but
    OpenShiftConnector does not include the annotation. This
    prevents Che from initialising if e.g. running on docker
    without the property set.

    * CHE-180: Creating and closing OpenShiftClient in every method of OpenshiftConnector

    Signed-off-by: Ilya Buziuk <ibuziuk@redhat.com>

    * Update route naming to make it work on OSO

    Signed-off-by: Mario Loriedo <mloriedo@redhat.com>

    * Rework PVC management on OpenShift

    - Change how subdirectories are created in pods to
      use a short, terminating job instead of a full deployment
    - Add OpenShiftWorkspaceFilesCleaner class to properly
      notice workspace deleted events
    - Add helper class to manage job pods. For creation, some
      effort is made to avoid attempting to create workspaces
      unnecessarily, but only exists in-memory
    - Workspace deletions are batched together so that removing
      workspaces directories can be done when server is idled,
      avoiding unnecessary PVC mounts
    - Add two new properties: che.openshift.jobs.image and
      che.openshift.jobs.memorylimit, which are used by
      OpenShiftPvcHelper to set up pods

    Current issues:
    - Since workspace directories are not deleted immediately,
      attempting to re-create a workspace with the same name
      will result in the previous instance's project to already
      be there. This should have a minor impact.
    - Memory for which workspace dirs have been created is not
      persisted, resulting in potentially unnecessary jobs
    - Openshift workspace files cleaner is included by overwriting
      binding in WsMasterModule instead of using a provider. This
      could be better, but OpenShift integration may be reaching a
      point where a custom module is a better solution.

    * Fix route server names if unknown should start with server-.

    https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CHE-230

    Signed-off-by: Sun Seng David Tan <sutan@redhat.com>

    * Add property to control manual workspace dir creation in OpenShift

    Add property 'che.openshift.precreate.workspace.dirs'. If property is
    true, OpenShiftConnector will run a pod before launching workspaces
    to create a subpath in the workspace's persistent volume with correct
    permissions. If the property is false, this step is skipped.

    This is necessary as in older versions of OpenShift/Kubernetes, subpaths
    created as part of a volume mount are created with root permissions, and
    so cannot be modified by workspace pods. More recent versions fix this,
    creating subpath volumes with correct permissions, making the step above
    unnecessary.

    * Add a `workspaceIdWithoutPrefix` macro and use it for `single-port`

    `workspace` prefix.

    Signed-off-by: David Festal <dfestal@redhat.com>

    * Add the `isDevMachine` to allow conditions in the ST template.

    This is required to allow the `single-port` strategy to have a different
    url according to the type of machine. (see the work done for CHE-175 :
    Support multi-container workspaces on OpenShift)

    * Fix failing Traeffik tests...

    ... by:

    - pulling up all the `CustomServerEvaluationStrategy` features in an
    abstract `BaseServerEvaluationStrategy` (which all other Che strategies
    extend) and have the `CustomServerEvaluationStrategy` class simply
    extend this `BaseServerEvaluationStrategy`.
