/** Rules return values in an object containing all the values.
 *  Besides the properties defined in
 *  RuleLabelScope.predefinedRulePropertiesScope there may be user-defined
 *  return values.  This class simply defines the minimum properties that
 *  are always defined and methods to access the others that might be
 *  available depending on output option such as template and tree.
 *
 *  Note text is not an actual property of the return value, it is computed
 *  from start and stop using the input stream's toString() method.  I
 *  could add a ctor to this so that we can pass in and store the input
 *  stream, but I'm not sure we want to do that.  It would seem to be undefined
 *  to get the .text property anyway if the rule matches tokens from multiple
 *  input streams.
 *
 *  I do not use getters for fields of objects that are used simply to
 *  group values such as this aggregate.  The getters/setters are there to
 *  satisfy the superclass interface.
