	/**
	 * This method provides the ability to verify that the version of the ANTLR
	 * 4 used to execute a parser is compatible with the Tool used to generate
	 * the parser code and/or the version of the runtime the parser was compiled
	 * against.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Starting with ANTLR 4.2.3, the code generator emits two constants in each
	 * generated parser: a hard-coded constant indicating the version of the
	 * tool used to generate the parser and a reference to the compile-time
	 * constant {@link #VERSION}. At runtime, this method is called to ensure
	 * that, according to the version numbers, the semantics of the generated
	 * code are known to be compatible with the version of the ANTLR runtime
	 * used to execute code.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * The definition of "semantic changes" which are considered by this method
	 * depend on the value of {@code extendedSemantics}. When this value is
	 * {@code false}, as is the case for calls to this method in generated code,
	 * "semantic changes" means changes in the runtime that alter the behavior
	 * of parsers that use only standardized language features, which does not
	 * include the behavior of target-language-specific features such as
	 * embedded actions, custom semantic predicates, and runtime methods that
	 * are never called by the generated code but may be overridden in separate
	 * user code. When this value is {@code true}, "semantic changes" indicates
	 * a wider check across frequently used aspects of the runtime. The latter
	 * case may or may not consider all breaking changes across releases; for
	 * details on the specific methods in place see the release notes for the
	 * affected version(s).</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Note that if this method throws an exception when
	 * {@code extendedSemantics} is {@code false}, the lexer or parser which
	 * resulted in the exception will be prevented from executing, so this
	 * behavior is reserved for changes that are true breaking changes in the
	 * behavior. These changes, if any, are mentioned in the release notes for
	 * the affected release.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Also note that some breaking changes between releases could result in
	 * other types of runtime exceptions, such as a {@link LinkageError}, prior
	 * to calling this method. This method is primarily intended to catch
	 * semantic changes that do not result in binary compatibility problems
	 * which would be detected by the class loader. As with semantic changes,
	 * changes which break binary compatibility between releases are mentioned
	 * in the release notes accompanying the affected release.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Additional note for target developers:</strong> The compatibility
	 * check implemented by this class is designed to address specific
	 * compatibility issues that may arise during the execution of Java
	 * applications. Other targets should consider the implementation of this
	 * method in the context of that target's known execution environment, which
	 * may or may not resemble the design provided for the Java target.</p>
	 *
	 * @param toolVersion The version of the tool used to generate a parser.
	 * This value may be null when called from user code that was not generated
	 * by, and does not reference, the ANTLR 4 Tool itself.
	 * @param compileTimeVersion The version of the runtime the parser was
	 * compiled against. This should always be passed using a direct reference
	 * to {@link #VERSION}.
	 * @param extendedSemantics {@code false} to only check compatibility for
	 * the API used in generated code, not counting embedded actions and
	 * semantic predicates; otherwise, {@code true} to check compatibility
	 * across a wider range of frequently-used features that are commonly used
	 * in user-defined embedded actions and/or semantic predicates.
	 *
	 * @exception ANTLRVersionMismatchException if the version of the ANTLR
	 * runtime used to execute a compiled parser contains semantic changes which
	 * would alter the behavior of the generated code

		 *  * Prior to ANTLR 4.2.3, the ANTLR tool did not emit calls to this
