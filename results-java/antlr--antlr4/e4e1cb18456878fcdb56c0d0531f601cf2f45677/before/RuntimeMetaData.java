/** Because targets can be updated at different times than the core tool, which includes this Java target,
 *  we created this runtime information object.  The goal is to test compatibility of the generated parser and
 *  the runtime library for that target it executes with.
 *
 *  Targets generate a tiny bit of code that executes upon loading of
 *  a parser or lexer, which should check its version against what is contained in this object. For example,
 *  here is something from the Java templates:
 *
 *    public class <parser.name> extends <superClass> {
 *        static { RuntimeMetaData.checkVersion("<file.ANTLRVersion>"); }
 *        ...
 *
 *  This way, previous versions of target X that are incompatible (e.g., 4.1 and 4.2) will result in
 *  a warning emitted through the appropriate channel for that target.  This can be a msg to stderr or
 *  an exception; it's up to the target developer. I have decided to throw an exception for Java target
 *  as a message might not be seen if the parser were embedded in a server or something.
