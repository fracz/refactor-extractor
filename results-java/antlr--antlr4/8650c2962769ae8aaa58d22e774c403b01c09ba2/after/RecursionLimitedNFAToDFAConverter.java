/**
 * closure: Add new NFA states + context to DFA state d.  Also add semantic
	 *  predicates to semantic context if collectPredicates is set.  We only
	 *  collect predicates at hoisting depth 0, meaning before any token/char
	 *  have been recognized.  This corresponds, during analysis, to the
	 *  initial DFA start state construction closure() invocation.
 *
 *  When is a closure operation in a cycle condition?  While it is
 *  very possible to have the same NFA state mentioned twice
 *  within the same DFA state, there are two situations that
 *  would lead to nontermination of closure operation:
 *
 *  o   Whenever closure reaches a configuration where the same state
 *      with same or a suffix context already exists.  This catches
 *      the IF-THEN-ELSE tail recursion cycle and things like
 *
 *      a : A a | B ;
 *
 *      the context will be $ (empty stack).
 *
 *      We have to check
 *      larger context stacks because of (...)+ loops.  For
 *      example, the context of a (...)+ can be nonempty if the
 *      surrounding rule is invoked by another rule:
 *
 *      a : b A | X ;
 *      b : (B|)+ ;  // nondeterministic by the way
 *
 *      The context of the (B|)+ loop is "invoked from item
 *      a : . b A ;" and then the empty alt of the loop can reach back
 *      to itself.  The context stack will have one "return
 *      address" element and so we must check for same state, same
 *      context for arbitrary context stacks.
 *
 *      Idea: If we've seen this configuration before during closure, stop.
 *      We also need to avoid reaching same state with conflicting context.
 *      Ultimately analysis would stop and we'd find the conflict, but we
 *      should stop the computation.  Previously I only checked for
 *      exact config.  Need to check for same state, suffix context
 * 		not just exact context.
 *
 *  o   Whenever closure reaches a configuration where state p
 *      is present in its own context stack.  This means that
 *      p is a rule invocation state and the target rule has
 *      been called before.  NFAContext.MAX_RECURSIVE_INVOCATIONS
 *      (See the comment there also) determines how many times
 *      it's possible to recurse; clearly we cannot recurse forever.
 *      Some grammars such as the following actually require at
 *      least one recursive call to correctly compute the lookahead:
 *
 *      a : L ID R
 *        | b
 *        ;
 *      b : ID
 *        | L a R
 *        ;
 *
 *      Input L ID R is ambiguous but to figure this out, ANTLR
 *      needs to go a->b->a->b to find the L ID sequence.
 *
 *      Do not allow closure to add a configuration that would
 *      allow too much recursion.
 *
 *      This case also catches infinite left recursion.

	/** This is similar to Bermudez's m constant in his LAR(m) where
	 *  you bound the stack so your states don't explode.  The main difference
	 *  is that I bound only recursion on the stack, not the simple stack size.
	 *  This looser constraint will let the conversion roam further to find
	 *  lookahead to resolve a decision.
	 *
	 *  Bermudez's m operates differently as it is his LR stack depth
	 *  I'm pretty sure it therefore includes all stack symbols.  Here I
	 *  restrict the size of an NFA configuration to be finite because a
	 *  stack component may mention the same NFA invocation state at
	 *  most m times.  Hence, the number of DFA states will not grow forever.
	 *  With recursive rules like
	 *
	 *    e : '(' e ')' | INT ;
	 *
	 *  you could chase your tail forever if somebody said "s : e '.' | e ';' ;"
	 *  This constant prevents new states from being created after a stack gets
	 *  "too big".  Actually (12/14/2007) I realize that this example is
	 *  trapped by the non-LL(*) detector for recursion in > 1 alt.  Here is
	 *  an example that trips stack overflow:
	 *
	 *	  s : a Y | A A A A A X ; // force recursion past m=4
	 *	  a : A a | Q;
	 *
	 *  If that were:
	 *
	 *	  s : a Y | A+ X ;
	 *
	 *  it could loop forever.
	 *
	 *  Imagine doing a depth-first search on the e DFA...as you chase an input
	 *  sequence you can recurse to same rule such as e above.  You'd have a
	 *  chain of ((((.  When you get do some point, you have to give up.  The
	 *  states in the chain will have longer and longer NFA config stacks.
	 *  Must limit size.
	 *
	 *  max=0 implies you cannot ever jump to another rule during closure.
	 *  max=1 implies you can make as many calls as you want--you just
	 *        can't ever visit a state that is on your rule invocation stack.
	 * 		  I.e., you cannot ever recurse.
	 *  max=2 implies you are able to recurse once (i.e., call a rule twice
	 *  	  from the same place).
	 *
	 *  This tracks recursion to a rule specific to an invocation site!
	 *  It does not detect multiple calls to a rule from different rule
	 *  invocation states.  We are guaranteed to terminate because the
	 *  stack can only grow as big as the number of NFA states * max.
	 *
	 *  I noticed that the Java grammar didn't work with max=1, but did with
	 *  max=4.  Let's set to 4. Recursion is sometimes needed to resolve some
	 *  fixed lookahead decisions.
