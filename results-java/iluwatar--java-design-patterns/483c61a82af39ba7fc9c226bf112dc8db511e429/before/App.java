/**
 *
 * <p>The Promise object is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents an operation that
 * hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.
 *
 * <p>A Promise represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It
 * allows you to associate dependent promises to an asynchronous action's eventual success value or
 * failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of the final
 * value, the asynchronous method returns a promise of having a value at some point in the future.
 *
 * <p>Promises provide a few advantages over callback objects:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Functional composition and error handling
 * <li> Prevents callback hell and provides callback aggregation
 * </ul>
