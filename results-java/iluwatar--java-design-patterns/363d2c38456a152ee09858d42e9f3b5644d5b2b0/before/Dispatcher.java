 * processing from application specific processing.
 * <br/>
 * Dispatcher should call the {@link ChannelHandler} associated with the channel on which event occurred.
 *
 * <p>
 * The application can customize the way in which event is dispatched such as using the reactor thread to
 * dispatch event to channels or use a worker pool to do the non I/O processing.
