/**
 * This application demonstrates Reactor pattern. It represents a Distributed Logging Service
 * where it can listen on multiple TCP or UDP sockets for incoming log requests.
 *
 * <p>
 * <i>INTENT</i>
 * <br/>
 * The Reactor design pattern handles service requests that are delivered concurrently to an
 * application by one or more clients. The application can register specific handlers for processing
 * which are called by reactor on specific events.
 *
 * <p>
 * <i>PROBLEM</i>
 * <br/>
 * Server applications in a distributed system must handle multiple clients that send them service
 * requests. Following forces need to be resolved:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Availability</li>
 * <li>Efficiency</li>
 * <li>Programming Simplicity</li>
 * <li>Adaptability</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The application utilizes single thread to listen for requests on all ports. It does not create
 * a separate thread for each client, which provides better scalability under load (number of clients
 * increase).
 *
 * <p>
 * The example uses Java NIO framework to implement the Reactor.
