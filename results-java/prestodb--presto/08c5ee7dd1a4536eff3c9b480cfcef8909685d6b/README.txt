    Upgrade airbase version to 46

     - As new airbase comes with new version of testng some tests had to be
    refactored as they started to fail.
     - Upgrade also airlift, discover-server and resolver to versions which
     also are using airbase at version 46, as with older version there were
     a dependency conflict.
