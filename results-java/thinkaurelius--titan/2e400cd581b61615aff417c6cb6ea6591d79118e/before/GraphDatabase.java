 * A graph database is the persistence framework for a graph consisting of {@link Node}s and {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.Edge}s.

 * been configured using the methods provided by{@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.configuration.GraphDatabaseConfiguration}.
 *
 * All user interactions with a graph database are channeled through {@link GraphTransaction}s. A graph
 * database only provides methods for starting new transactions which in turn provide the means to modify
