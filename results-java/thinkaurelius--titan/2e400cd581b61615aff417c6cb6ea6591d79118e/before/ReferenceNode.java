/**
 * A reference node represents a {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.Node} which is not loaded into the current transaction and therefore has
 * to be interacted with by means of remote communication.
 *
 * In most cases, reference nodes represent remotely stored nodes of a graph database which are not retrieved into
 * the current transaction but only referenced. In such cases, interacting with such nodes has to be done by means
 * of remote communication via the methods provided in this interface.
 *
 * Whether or not reference nodes may exist in a given transaction depends on the implementation of the underlying
 * {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.GraphDatabase}. Most single-machine implementations of {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.GraphDatabase} do not use reference nodes.
 *
 * A reference node does not provide the methods of a normal {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.Node} beyond those of {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.Entity}.
 * In order to interact with a reference
 * node, the user has to send queries remotely using a message passing framework provided by the {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.GraphDatabase}
 * and exposed through the methods in this interface.
 *
 * To check whether any given {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.Node} is actually a reference node, use the {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.Entity#isReferenceNode()}
 * method.
