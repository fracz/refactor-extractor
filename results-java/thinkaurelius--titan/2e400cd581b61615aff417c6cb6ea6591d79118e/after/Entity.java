/***
 * Represents the abstract concept of an entity in the graph and specifies basic methods for interacting
 * with entities.
 * The two basic entities in a graph database are {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.Edge}s and {@link Node}s.
 * Entities have a life cycle state which reflects the current state of the entity with respect
 * to the {@link GraphTransaction} in which it occurs. An entity may be in any one of these states
 * and any given time:
 * <ul>
 * <li>New: The entity has been created in the current transaction</li>
 * <li>Loaded: The entity has been loaded from disk into the current transaction and has not been modified</li>
 * <li>Modified: The entity has been loaded from disk into the current transaction and has been modified</li>
 * <li>Deleted: The entity has been deleted in the current transaction</li>
 * <li>ReferenceNode: The entity is a reference to a remotely hosted node. It cannot be loaded into the current transaction but
 * only references the actual entity. This only applies when running Titan embedded in a distributed environment.
 *
 * Depending on the concrete type of the entity, an entity may be identifiable,
 * i.e. it has a unique ID which can be retrieved via {@link #getID()}
 * (use {@link #hasID()} to determine if a given entity has a unique ID).
