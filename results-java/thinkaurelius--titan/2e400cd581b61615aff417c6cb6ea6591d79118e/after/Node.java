/**
 * {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.Node} is one of the two basic entities of a graph - the other one being {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.Edge}.
 * A node, also called vertex, can represent an object, individual, or other identifiable entity which have properties ({@link Property}
 * and engages in relationships ({@link Relationship}). Nodes are connected to one other via relationships.
 * For more information on the mathematical definition of a graph and the concept of nodes see
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29">Graph Definition</a>.
 *
 * Nodes are the first thing to be created in a graph in the context of a {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.GraphTransaction}. Nodes have incident {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.Edge}s which
 * are either {@link Relationship}s to other nodes or {@link Property}es defining attributes of the node such as unique ids.
