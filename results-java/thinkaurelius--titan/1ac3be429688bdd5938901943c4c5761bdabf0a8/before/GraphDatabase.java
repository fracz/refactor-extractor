/***
 * A graph database is the persistence framework for a graph consisting of {@link Node}s and {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.core.Edge}s.
 *
 * A graph database implementation coordinates all retrieval and persistence operations against the stored
 * graph. A graph database is opened via {@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.configuration.GraphDatabaseConfiguration#openDatabase()} after it has
 * been configured using the methods provided by{@link com.thinkaurelius.titan.configuration.GraphDatabaseConfiguration}.
 *
 * All user interactions with a graph database are channeled through {@link GraphTransaction}s. A graph
 * database only provides methods for starting new transactions which in turn provide the means to modify
 * the stored graph.
