    Major untested Metrics refactoring

    Made Metrics configuration transaction-centric.  Each graph
    transaction can be configured to disable metrics, enable metrics, or
    enable metrics with a custom metric name prefix.  The last option is
    intended to let users segregate Metrics measurements generated by
    Titan in whatever way they like -- for instance, by setting the
    metrics prefix to the name of an application or the name of an account
    originating the tx.  User provided metric prefix strings override the
    Titan default and will appear in whatever Metrics reporter targets the
    user configures, such as Ganglia or Graphite.

    This commit is a probably-buggy refactoring baseline.  It reflects the
    broad strokes structural changes that I wanted to do in Metrics
    configuration, but I've probably messed up the details somewhere.
    Additional bugfix commits likely to follow...
