public TypeMaker multiValued();||||||||/**
 * Configures this property to allow multiple values to be associated with a single vertex via this key. By default, only a single
 * value can be associated with any given vertex at any one time through a key. <br/>
 * For example, by declaring the property key "name" to be multi-valued, a vertex can have multiple name properties which can be
 * retrieved by {@link TitanVertex#getProperties(TitanKey)}.
 * <p/>
 * Note, that adding properties for multi-valued keys must be done through {@link TitanVertex#addProperty(TitanKey, Object)} and NOT
 * {@link TitanVertex#setProperty(TitanKey, Object)} which is reserved for single-valued property keys (the default).
 * <p/>
 * This configuration option only applies to property keys.
