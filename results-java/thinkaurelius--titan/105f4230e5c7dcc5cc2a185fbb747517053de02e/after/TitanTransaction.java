/***
 * A graph transaction is the interface to interact with a graph database.
 *
 * All node and edge retrievals are channeled by a graph transaction which bundles all such retrievals, creations and
 * deletions into one transaction. A graph transaction is analogous to a
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction">database transaction</a>.
 * The isolation level and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID support</a> are configured through the storage
 * backend, meaning whatever level of isolation is supported by the storage backend is mirrored by a graph transaction.
 *
 * A graph transaction supports:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Creating nodes, properties and relationships</li>
 * <li>Creating edge types</li>
 * <li>Index-based retrieval of nodes</li>
 * <li>Querying edges and neighborhoods</li>
 * <li>Aborting and committing transaction</li>
 * </ul>
