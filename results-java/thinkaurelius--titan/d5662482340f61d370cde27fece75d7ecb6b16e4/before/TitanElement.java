/**
 * TitanElement represents the abstract concept of an entity in the graph and specifies basic methods for interacting
 * with entities.
 * The two basic entities in a graph database are {@link TitanRelation} and {@link TitanVertex}.
 * Entities have a life cycle state which reflects the current state of the entity with respect
 * to the {@link TitanTransaction} in which it occurs. An entity may be in any one of these states
 * and any given time:
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>New:</strong> The entity has been created in the current transaction</li>
 * <li><strong>Loaded:</strong> The entity has been loaded from disk into the current transaction and has not been modified</li>
 * <li><strong>Modified:</strong> The entity has been loaded from disk into the current transaction and has been modified</li>
 * <li><strong>Deleted:</strong> The entity has been deleted in the current transaction</li>
 * </ul>
 * Depending on the concrete type of the entity, an entity may be identifiable,
 * i.e. it has a unique ID which can be retrieved via {@link #getID}
 * (use {@link #hasID} to determine if a given entity has a unique ID).
