/**
 * Low Inter-reference Recency Set replacement policy.

  /*
   * IRR of a block refers to the number of other blocks accessed between two consecutive references
   * to the block. Specifically, the recency refers to the number of other blocks accessed from last
   * reference to the current time. We assume that if the IRR of a block is large, the next IRR of
   * the block is likely to be large again. Following this assumption, we select the blocks with
   * large IRRs for replacement, because these blocks are highly possible to be evicted later by LRU
   * before being referenced again.
   *
   * It dynamically and responsively distinguishes low IRR (denoted as LIR) blocks from high IRR
   * (denoted as HIR) blocks, and keeps the LIR blocks in the cache, where the recencies of blocks
   * are only used to help determine LIR or HIR statuses of blocks. We maintain an LIR block set and
   * an HIR block set, and manage to limit the size of the LIR set so that all the LIR blocks in the
   * set can fit in the cache. The blocks in the LIR set are not chosen for replacement, and there
   * are no misses with references to these blocks. Only a very small portion of the cache is
   * assigned to store HIR blocks. Resident HIR blocks may be evicted at any recency. However, when
   * the recency of an LIR block increases to a certain point, and an HIR block gets accessed at a
   * smaller recency than that of the LIR block, the statuses of the two blocks are switched.
   *
   * We also divide the cache, whose size in blocks is L, into a major part and a minor part in
   * terms of the size. The major part with the size of Llirs is used to store LIR blocks, and the
   * minor part with the size of Lhirs is used to store blocks from HIR block set, where Llirs +
   * Lhirs = L. When a miss occurs and a free block is needed for replacement, we choose an HIR
   * block that is resident in the cache. LIR block set always resides in the cache and there are no
   * misses for the references to LIR blocks. However, a reference to an HIR block would likely to
   * encounter a miss, because Lhirs is very small (its practical size can be as small as 1% of the
   * cache size).
   *
   * 1. Upon accessing an LIR block X: This access is guaranteed to be a hit in the cache. We move
   * it to the top of stack S. If the LIR block is originally located in the bottom of the stack, we
   * conduct a stack pruning.
   *
   * 2. Upon accessing an HIR resident block X: This is a hit in the cache. We move it to the top of
   * stack S. There are two cases for block X: (1) If X is in the stack S, we change its status to
   * LIR. This block is also removed from list Q. The LIR block in the bottom of S is moved to the
   * end of list Q with its status changed to HIR. A stack pruning is then conducted. (2) If X is
   * not in stack S, we leave its status in HIR and move it to the end of list Q.
   *
   * 3. Upon accessing an HIR non-resident block X: This is a miss. We remove the HIR resident block
   * at the front of list Q (it then becomes a non-resident block), and replace it out of the cache.
   * Then we load the requested block X into the freed buffer and place it on the top of stack S.
   * There are two cases for block X: (1) If X is in stack S, we change its status to LIR and move
   * the LIR block in the bottom of stack S to the end of list Q with its status changed to HIR. A
   * stack pruning is then conducted. (2) If X is not in stack S, we leave its status in HIR and
   * place it in the end of list Q.
