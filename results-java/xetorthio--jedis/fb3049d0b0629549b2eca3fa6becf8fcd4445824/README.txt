    improve slots cache initializeâ€˜s retry logic (#1402)

    * improve slots cache initialize's retry logic

    [Motivation]
    When jedis.auth(password) throw JedisConnectionException, it won't retry
    next node. This should be improved.

    [Modifications]
    Move the code about auth/clientSetname into try-catch statements.

    [Result]
    When jedis fail to setup connection with one node to initial slots
    cache, it will retry next one.

    * remove similar case
