    ZOOKEEPER-2829: Interface usability / compatibility improvements through Java annotation.

    This patch uses Apache Yetus audience annotations to label our publicly available interfaces and then generate our javadoc based on the annotations. The javadoc generated by this patch should be identical to our javadoc before with a few extra classes (that I think should have been included before anyway).

    HostProvider
    Record
    StaticHostProvider
    Transaction
    ZKClientConfig

    The "gotcha" with this patch is the way that java classes generated by jute are handled. There are four of these classes that need to be publicly documented: ACL, Id, Stat, StatPersisted (in addition to their superclass Record). I thought it would be safest to have the jute compiler always label these as "Public" and then we can filter out the ones we don't want in the javadoc ant task (by excluding the org.apache.zookeeper.server package and then pulling in the tools classes separately).
