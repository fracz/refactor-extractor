    Addresses Issue 1348 and Issue 95

    Not done, yet, but available for developers to use.

    Definite things to be done in the short term:

    2) Make newly arrived mail immediately appear in search results.

    Possible improvements:
    3) User-definable searches
    4) Make newly deleted mail immediately disappear search results.
    5) Make message with flag changes immediately appear/disappear from
       search results.
    6) Show search result size in Accounts Activity.
