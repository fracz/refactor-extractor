    Fixes Issue 1410
    Fixes Issue 1431

    Present flagged message count inside a star, matching the visual
    presentation on individual messages.

    Provide display of unread and flagged message counts for canned
    searches.

    Perhaps the message counts for searches and account size display
    should be defeatable for improved speed.
