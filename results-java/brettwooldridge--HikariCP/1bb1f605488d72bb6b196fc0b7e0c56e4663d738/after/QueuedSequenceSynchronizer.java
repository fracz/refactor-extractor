/**
 * A specialized "lock" class that permits resource tracking through the
 * use of a monotonically-increasing long sequence.  When a shared resource
 * becomes available the {@link #increment()} method should be called.
 * <p>
 * A thread wishing to acquire a resource should obtain the current sequence
 * from the {@link #getSequence()} method before calling {@link #waitUntilThresholdExceeded(long, long)}
 * with that sequence.  Upon receiving a <code>true</code> result from
 * {@link #waitUntilThresholdExceeded(long, long)}, the current sequence
 * should again be obtained from the {@link #getSequence()} method, and an
 * attempt to acquire the resource should be made.  If the shared resource cannot
 * be acquired, the thread should again call {@link #waitUntilThresholdExceeded(long, long)}
 * with the previously obtained sequence.
 * <p>
 * When running on Java 8 and above, this class leverages the fact that when {@link LongAdder}
 * is monotonically increasing, and only {@link LongAdder#increment()} and {@link LongAdder#sum()}
 * are used, it can be relied on to be Sequentially Consistent.
