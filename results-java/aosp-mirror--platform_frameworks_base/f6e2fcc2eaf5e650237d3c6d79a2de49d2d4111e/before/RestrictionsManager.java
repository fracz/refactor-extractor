/**
 * Provides a mechanism for apps to query restrictions imposed by an entity that
 * manages the user. Apps can also send permission requests to a local or remote
 * device administrator to override default app-specific restrictions or any other
 * operation that needs explicit authorization from the administrator.
 * <p>
 * Apps can expose a set of restrictions via a runtime receiver mechanism or via
 * static meta data in the manifest.
 * <p>
 * If the user has an active restrictions provider, dynamic requests can be made in
 * addition to the statically imposed restrictions. Dynamic requests are app-specific
 * and can be expressed via a predefined set of templates.
 * <p>
 * The RestrictionsManager forwards the dynamic requests to the active
 * restrictions provider. The restrictions provider can respond back to requests by calling
 * {@link #notifyPermissionResponse(String, Bundle)}, when
 * a response is received from the administrator of the device or user
 * The response is relayed back to the application via a protected broadcast,
 * {@link #ACTION_PERMISSION_RESPONSE_RECEIVED}.
 * <p>
 * Static restrictions are specified by an XML file referenced by a meta-data attribute
 * in the manifest. This enables applications as well as any web administration consoles
 * to be able to read the template from the apk.
 * <p>
 * The syntax of the XML format is as follows:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;restrictions&gt;
 *     &lt;restriction
 *         android:key="&lt;key&gt;"
 *         android:restrictionType="boolean|string|integer|multi-select|null"
 *         ... /&gt;
 *     &lt;restriction ... /&gt;
 * &lt;/restrictions&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The attributes for each restriction depend on the restriction type.
 *
