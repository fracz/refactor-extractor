/**
 * Simplified @link android.content.AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter. Folds that
 * behaviour into a service to which the system can bind when requesting an
 * anonymous (providerless/accountless) sync.
 * <p>
 * In order to perform an anonymous sync operation you must extend this service, implementing the
 * abstract methods. This service must be declared in the application's manifest as usual. You
 * can use this service for other work, however you <b> must not </b> override the onBind() method
 * unless you know what you're doing, which limits the usefulness of this service for other work.
 * <p>A {@link SyncService} can either be active or inactive. Different to an
 * {@link AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter}, there is no
 * {@link ContentResolver#setSyncAutomatically(android.accounts.Account account, String provider, boolean sync)},
 * as well as no concept of initialisation (you can handle your own if needed).
 *
 * <pre>
 * &lt;service android:name=".MySyncService"/&gt;
 * </pre>
 * Like @link android.content.AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter this service supports
 * multiple syncs at the same time. Each incoming startSync() with a unique tag
 * will spawn a thread to do the work of that sync. If startSync() is called
 * with a tag that already exists, a SyncResult.ALREADY_IN_PROGRESS is returned.
 * Remember that your service will spawn multiple threads if you schedule multiple syncs
 * at once, so if you mutate local objects you must ensure synchronization.
