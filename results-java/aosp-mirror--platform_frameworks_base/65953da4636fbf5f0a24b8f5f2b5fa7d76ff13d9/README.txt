    Multi-Project Commit: Move of filterfw out of system/media (2 of 7)

    This is part of the multi-project commit to move the filter-framework
    from system/media/mca to frameworks/base/media/mca.

    Note that the filter-framework will soon be replaced with a refactored
    version currently under API review (also to go under frameworks/base).
    This move is done now to unblock the PDK efforts.
