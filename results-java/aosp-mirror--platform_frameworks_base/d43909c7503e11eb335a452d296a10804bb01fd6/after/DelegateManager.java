/**
 * Manages native delegates.
 *
 * This is used in conjunction with layoublib_create: certain Android java classes are mere
 * wrappers around a heavily native based implementation, and we need a way to run these classes
 * in our Eclipse rendering framework without bringing all the native code from the Android
 * platform.
 *
 * Thus we instruct layoutlib_create to modify the bytecode of these classes to replace their
 * native methods by "delegate calls".
 *
 * For example, a native method android.graphics.Matrix.init(...) will actually become
 * a call to android.graphics.Matrix_Delegate.init(...).
 *
 * The Android java classes that use native code uses an int (Java side) to reference native
 * objects. This int is generally directly the pointer to the C structure counterpart.
 * Typically a creation method will return such an int, and then this int will be passed later
 * to a Java method to identify the C object to manipulate.
 *
 * Since we cannot use the Java object reference as the int directly, DelegateManager manages the
 * int -> Delegate class link.
 *
 * Native methods usually always have the int as parameters. The first thing the delegate method
 * will do is call {@link #getDelegate(int)} to get the Java object matching the int.
 *
 * Typical native init methods are returning a new int back to the Java class, so
 * {@link #addDelegate(Object)} does the same.
 *
 * @param <T> the delegate class to manage
