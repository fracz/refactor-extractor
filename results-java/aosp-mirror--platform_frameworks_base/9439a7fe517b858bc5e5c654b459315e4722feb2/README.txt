    Add javax.obex library, contributed by Motorola.

    Based of a JSR-82 reference implementation.

    This check-in is 'as-is' from the source provided June 25.

    This code does not conform to Android style and quality guidelines. I will be
    working with Motorola to improve it. If it does not see substantial improvement
    in the Eclair timeframe it will be deleted.
