    TTS API: Replace "voice id" with "voice name"

    "Voice id" and "voice name" are both used to reference a voice in a
    speech synthesis request. Voice id was a random integer, where
    voice name is human readable string, that provides more debug
    information and readability. Also, it's expected that voice name
    will stay consistent, and won't change during the life of the speech
    connection. Though, it may disappear.
