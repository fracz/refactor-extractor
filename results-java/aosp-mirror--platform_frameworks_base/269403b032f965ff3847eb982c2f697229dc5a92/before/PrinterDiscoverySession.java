/**
 * This class encapsulates the interaction between a print service and the
 * system during printer discovery. During printer discovery you are responsible
 * for adding discovered printers, removing already added printers that
 * disappeared, and updating already added printers.
 * <p>
 * The opening of the session is announced by a call to {@link
 * PrinterDiscoverySession#onOpen(List)} at which point you should start printer
 * discovery. The closing of the session is announced by a call to {@link
 * PrinterDiscoverySession#onClose()} at which point you should stop printer
 * discovery. Discovered printers are added by invoking {@link
 * PrinterDiscoverySession#addPrinters(List)}. Added printers that disappeared
 * are removed by invoking {@link PrinterDiscoverySession#removePrinters(List)}.
 * Added printers whose properties or capabilities changed are updated through
 * a call to {@link PrinterDiscoverySession#updatePrinters(List)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The system will make a call to
 * {@link PrinterDiscoverySession#onRequestPrinterUpdate(PrinterId)} if you
 * need to update a given printer. It is possible that you add a printer without
 * specifying its capabilities. This enables you to avoid querying all
 * discovered printers for their capabilities, rather querying the capabilities
 * of a printer only if necessary. For example, the system will require that you
 * update a printer if it gets selected by the user. If you did not report the
 * printer capabilities when adding it, you must do so after the system requests
 * a printer update. Otherwise, the printer will be ignored.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * During printer discovery all printers that are known to your print service
 * have to be added. The system does not retain any printers from previous
 * sessions.
