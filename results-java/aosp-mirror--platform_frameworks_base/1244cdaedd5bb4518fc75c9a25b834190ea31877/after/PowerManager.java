/**
 * This class gives you control of the power state of the device.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Device battery life will be significantly affected by the use of this API.</b>
 * Do not acquire {@link WakeLock}s unless you really need them, use the minimum levels
 * possible, and be sure to release them as soon as possible.
 * </p><p>
 * You can obtain an instance of this class by calling
 * {@link android.content.Context#getSystemService(java.lang.String) Context.getSystemService()}.
 * </p><p>
 * The primary API you'll use is {@link #newWakeLock(int, String) newWakeLock()}.
 * This will create a {@link PowerManager.WakeLock} object.  You can then use methods
 * on the wake lock object to control the power state of the device.
 * </p><p>
 * In practice it's quite simple:
 * {@samplecode
 * PowerManager pm = (PowerManager) getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
 * PowerManager.WakeLock wl = pm.newWakeLock(PowerManager.SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK, "My Tag");
 * wl.acquire();
 *   ..screen will stay on during this section..
 * wl.release();
 * }
 * </p><p>
 * The following flags are defined, with varying effects on system power.
 * <i>These flags are mutually exclusive - you may only specify one of them.</i>
 *
 * <table border="2" width="85%" align="center" frame="hsides" rules="rows">
 *     <thead>
 *     <tr><th>Flag Value</th>
 *     <th>CPU</th> <th>Screen</th> <th>Keyboard</th></tr>
 *     </thead>
 *
 *     <tbody>

 *         <td>On</td> <td>Bright</td> <td>Bright</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     </tbody>
 * </table>
 * </p><p>
 * *<i>If you hold a partial wake lock, the CPU will continue to run, regardless of any
 * display timeouts or the state of the screen and even after the user presses the power button.
 * In all other wake locks, the CPU will run, but the user can still put the device to sleep
 * using the power button.</i>
 * </p><p>
 * In addition, you can add two more flags, which affect behavior of the screen only.
 * <i>These flags have no effect when combined with a {@link #PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK}.</i>
 *
 * <table border="2" width="85%" align="center" frame="hsides" rules="rows">

 *         the illumination to remain on once it turns on (e.g. from user activity).  This flag
 *         will force the screen and/or keyboard to turn on immediately, when the WakeLock is
 *         acquired.  A typical use would be for notifications which are important for the user to
 *         see immediately.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *
 *     <tr><th>{@link #ON_AFTER_RELEASE}</th>
 *         <td>If this flag is set, the user activity timer will be reset when the WakeLock is

 *     </tr>
 *     </tbody>
