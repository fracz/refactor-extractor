/**
 * <p>
 * This is the base class for implementing print services. A print service
 * knows how to discover and interact one or more printers via one or more
 * protocols.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Printer discovery</h3>
 * <p>
 * A print service is responsible for discovering and reporting printers.
 * A printer discovery period starts with a call to
 * {@link #onStartPrinterDiscovery()} and ends with a call to
 * {@link #onStopPrinterDiscovery()}. During a printer discovery
 * period the print service reports newly discovered printers by
 * calling {@link #addDiscoveredPrinters(List)} and reports added printers
 * that disappeared by calling {@link #removeDiscoveredPrinters(List)}.
 * Calls to {@link #addDiscoveredPrinters(List)} and
 * {@link #removeDiscoveredPrinters(List)} before a call to
 * {@link #onStartPrinterDiscovery()} and after a call to
 * {@link #onStopPrinterDiscovery()} are a no-op.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For every printer discovery period all printers have to be added. Each
 * printer known to this print service should be added only once during a
 * discovery period, unless it was added and then removed before that.
 * Only an already added printer can be removed.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Print jobs</h3>
 * <p>
 * When a new print job targeted to the printers managed by this print
 * service is queued, i.e. ready for processing by the print service,
 * a call to {@link #onPrintJobQueued(PrintJob)} is made and the print
 * service may handle it immediately or schedule that for an appropriate
 * time in the future. The list of all print jobs for this service
 * are be available by calling {@link #getPrintJobs()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A print service is responsible for setting the print job state as
 * appropriate while processing it. Initially, a print job is in a
 * {@link PrintJobInfo#STATE_QUEUED} state which means that the data to
 * be printed is spooled by the system and the print service can obtain
 * that data by calling {@link PrintJob#getDocument()}. A queued print
 * job's {@link PrintJob#isQueued()} method returns true.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After the print service starts printing the data it should set the
 * print job state to {@link PrintJobInfo#STATE_STARTED} by calling
 * {@link PrintJob#start()}. Upon successful completion, the print job
 * state has to be set to {@link PrintJobInfo#STATE_COMPLETED} by calling
 * {@link PrintJob#complete()}. In case of a failure, the print job
 * state should be set to {@link PrintJobInfo#STATE_FAILED} by calling
 * {@link PrintJob#fail(CharSequence)}. If a print job is in a
 * {@link PrintJobInfo#STATE_STARTED} state, i.e. {@link PrintJob#isStarted()}
 * return true, and the user requests to cancel it, the print service will
 * receive a call to {@link #onRequestCancelPrintJob(PrintJob)} which
 * requests from the service to do a best effort in canceling the job. In
 * case the job is successfully canceled, its state has to be set to
 * {@link PrintJobInfo#STATE_CANCELED}. by calling {@link PrintJob#cancel()}.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of a print service is managed exclusively by the system
 * and follows the established service lifecycle. Additionally, starting
 * or stopping a print service is triggered exclusively by an explicit
 * user action through enabling or disabling it in the device settings.
 * After the system binds to a print service, it calls {@link #onConnected()}.
 * This method can be overriden by clients to perform post binding setup.
 * Also after the system unbinds from a print service, it calls
 * {@link #onDisconnected()}. This method can be overriden by clients to
 * perform post unbinding cleanup.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Declaration</h3>
 * <p>
 * A print service is declared as any other service in an AndroidManifest.xml
 * but it must also specify that it handles the {@link android.content.Intent}
 * with action {@link #SERVICE_INTERFACE}. Failure to declare this intent
 * will cause the system to ignore the print service. Additionally, a print
 * service must request the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_PRINT_SERVICE}
 * permission to ensure that only the system can bind to it. Failure to
 * declare this intent will cause the system to ignore the print service.
 * Following is an example declaration:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * &lt;service android:name=".MyPrintService"
 *         android:permission="android.permission.BIND_PRINT_SERVICE"&gt;
 *     &lt;intent-filter&gt;
 *         &lt;action android:name="android.printservice.PrintService" /&gt;
 *     &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
 *     . . .
 * &lt;/service&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <h3>Configuration</h3>
 * <p>
 * A print service can be configured by specifying an optional settings
 * activity which exposes service specific options, an optional add
 * prints activity which is used for manual addition of printers, vendor
 * name ,etc. It is a responsibility of the system to launch the settings
 * and add printers activities when appropriate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A print service is configured by providing a
 * {@link #SERVICE_META_DATA meta-data} entry in the manifest when declaring
 * the service. A service declaration with a meta-data tag is presented
 * below:
 * <pre> &lt;service android:name=".MyPrintService"
 *         android:permission="android.permission.BIND_PRINT_SERVICE"&gt;
 *     &lt;intent-filter&gt;
 *         &lt;action android:name="android.printservice.PrintService" /&gt;
 *     &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
 *     &lt;meta-data android:name="android.printservice" android:resource="@xml/printservice" /&gt;
 * &lt;/service&gt;</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more details refer to {@link #SERVICE_META_DATA} and
 * <code>&lt;{@link android.R.styleable#PrintService print-service}&gt;</code>.
 * </p>
