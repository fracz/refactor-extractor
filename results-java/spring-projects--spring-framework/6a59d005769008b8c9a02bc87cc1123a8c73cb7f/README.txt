    Fix references and typos in Spring MVC Test Javadoc

    This commit fixes numerous references to 'legacy' packages within the
    Javadoc for the Spring MVC Test framework.

    In addition, this commit improves examples in Javadoc, adds links to
    related classes where appropriate, and removes unnecessary imports for
    types that are only referenced within documentation.
