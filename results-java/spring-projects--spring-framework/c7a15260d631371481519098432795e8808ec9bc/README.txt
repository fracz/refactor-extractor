    Various DataBuffer improvements

    This commit introduces various improvements in DataBuffer:

    - DataBuffer now exposes its read and write position, as well as its
    capacity and writable byte count.
    - Added DataBuffer.asByteBuffer(int, int)
    - DataBufferUtils.read now reads directly into a DataBuffer, rather than
    copying a ByteBuffer into a DataBuffer
    - TomcatHttpHandler now reads directly into a DataBuffer
