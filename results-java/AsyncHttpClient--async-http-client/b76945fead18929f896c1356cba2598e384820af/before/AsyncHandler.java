package com.ning.http.client;

/**
 * An asynchronous handler or callback which gets invoked as soon as some data is available when
 * processing an asynchronous response.<br/>
 * Callback methods get invoked in the following order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #onStatusReceived(HttpResponseStatus)},</li>
 * <li>{@link #onHeadersReceived(HttpResponseHeaders)},</li>
 * <li>{@link #onBodyPartReceived(HttpResponseBodyPart)}, which could be invoked multiple times,</li>
 * <li>{@link #onCompleted()}, once the response has been fully read.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Returning a {@link AsyncHandler.STATE#ABORT} from any of those callback methods will interrupt asynchronous response
 * processing, after that only {@link #onCompleted()} is going to be called.
 * <p/>
 *
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> Sending another asynchronous request from an {@link AsyncHandler} must be done using
 * another thread to avoid potential deadlock inside the {@link com.ning.http.client.AsyncHttpProvider}
 * <p/>
 *
 * The recommended way is to use the {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} from the {@link AsyncHttpClientConfig#executorService()}:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     &#64;Override
 *         public T onCompleted() throws Exception
 *         &#123;
 *             asyncHttpClient.getConfig().executorService().execute(new Runnable()
 *             &#123;
 *                 public void run()
 *                 &#123;
 *                     asyncHttpClient.prepareGet(...);
 *                 &#125;
 *             &#125;);
 *            return T;
 *         &#125;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T> Type of object returned by the {@link java.util.concurrent.Future#get}
