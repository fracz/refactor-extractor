PHP Markdown Extra
==================

Description
-----------

This is a PHP port of the original Markdown formatter written in Perl
by John Gruber. This special "Extra" version of PHP Markdown features
further enhancements to the syntax for making additional constructs
such as tables and definition list.

Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read /
easy-to-write structured text format into HTML. Markdown's text format
is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features such
as headers, *emphasis*, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.

Markdown's syntax is designed not as a generic markup language, but
specifically to serve as a front-end to (X)HTML. You can use span-level
HTML tags anywhere in a Markdown document, and you can use block level
HTML tags (like <div> and <table> as well).

For more information about Markdown's syntax, see:
