	/**
	 * Embed the enclosure using Javascript
	 *
	 * `$options` is an array or comma-separated key:value string, with the
	 * following properties:
	 *
	 * - `alt` (string): Alternate content for when an end-user does not have
	 *    the appropriate handler installed or when a file type is
	 *    unsupported. Can be any text or HTML. Defaults to blank.
	 * - `altclass` (string): If a file type is unsupported, the end-user will
	 *    see the alt text (above) linked directly to the content. That link
	 *    will have this value as its class name. Defaults to blank.
	 * - `audio` (string): This is an image that should be used as a
	 *    placeholder for audio files before they're loaded (QuickTime-only).
	 *    Can be any relative or absolute URL. Defaults to blank.
	 * - `bgcolor` (string): The background color for the media, if not
	 *    already transparent. Defaults to `#ffffff`.
	 * - `height` (integer): The height of the embedded media. Accepts any
	 *    numeric pixel value (such as `360`) or `auto`. Defaults to `auto`,
	 *    and it is recommended that you use this default.
	 * - `loop` (boolean): Do you want the media to loop when its done?
	 *    Defaults to `false`.
	 * - `mediaplayer` (string): The location of the included
	 *    `mediaplayer.swf` file. This allows for the playback of Flash Video
	 *    (`.flv`) files, and is the default handler for non-Odeo MP3's.
	 *    Defaults to blank.
	 * - `video` (string): This is an image that should be used as a
	 *    placeholder for video files before they're loaded (QuickTime-only).
	 *    Can be any relative or absolute URL. Defaults to blank.
	 * - `width` (integer): The width of the embedded media. Accepts any
	 *    numeric pixel value (such as `480`) or `auto`. Defaults to `auto`,
	 *    and it is recommended that you use this default.
	 * - `widescreen` (boolean): Is the enclosure widescreen or standard?
	 *    This applies only to video enclosures, and will automatically resize
	 *    the content appropriately.  Defaults to `false`, implying 4:3 mode.
	 *
	 * Note: Non-widescreen (4:3) mode with `width` and `height` set to `auto`
	 * will default to 480x360 video resolution.  Widescreen (16:9) mode with
	 * `width` and `height` set to `auto` will default to 480x270 video resolution.
	 *
	 * @todo If the dimensions for media:content are defined, use them when width/height are set to 'auto'.
	 * @param array|string $options Comma-separated key:value list, or array
	 * @param bool $native Use `<embed>`
	 * @return string HTML string to output
