    Update reference docs to a more modern CSS style

    This change upgrade the framework to consume the newly-published
    docbook-reference-plugin version 0.2.0, which includes among other
    improvements a revamped CSS approach designed to look as similar
    as possible to the way markdown files are rendered by GitHub.

    See associated commit [1] at SpringSource's gradle-plugins repo for
    further details.
