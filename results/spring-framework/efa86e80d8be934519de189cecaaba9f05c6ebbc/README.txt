    Upgrade json-path to 0.9.0 version

    This version fixed bugs and improved performance.
    New features: "select multiple attributes" and
    "Array operations and slicing improved" (a new example
    has been added in tests to reflect that).

    See https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath/blob/master/README
