	 * all Data Type modules should throw a GDException in the event of a problem during creation of database
	 * tables. If a problem occurs, all tables created are rolled back and an appropriate error message is displayed

	 *
	 * Note: if this function determines that the values entered by the user in the options column are invalid
	 * (most likely just incomplete) the function can explicitly return false to tell the core script to ignore
	 * this row.

	 * @param array $post the entire contents of $_POST

	 * @param integer the number of columns in the data set
