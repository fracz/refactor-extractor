	 * This is called once during the initial installation of the script, or when the installation is reset (which is
	 * effectively a fresh install). It is called AFTER the Core tables are installed, and you can rely
	 * on Core::$db having been initialized and the database connection having been set up. For robustness,
	 * all Data Type modules should throw a GDException in the event of a problem during creation of database
	 * tables. If a problem occurs, all tables created are rolled back and an appropriate error message is displayed
	 * to the user. If no problems occur, this method should return and do nothing.
