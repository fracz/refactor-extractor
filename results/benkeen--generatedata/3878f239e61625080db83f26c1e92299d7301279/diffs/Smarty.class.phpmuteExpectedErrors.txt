            error muting is done because some people implemented custom error_handlers using
            http://php.net/set_error_handler and for some reason did not understand the following paragraph:

                It is important to remember that the standard PHP error handler is completely bypassed for the
                error types specified by error_types unless the callback function returns FALSE.
                error_reporting() settings will have no effect and your error handler will be called regardless -
                however you are still able to read the current value of error_reporting and act appropriately.
                Of particular note is that this value will be 0 if the statement that caused the error was
                prepended by the @ error-control operator.

            Smarty deliberately uses @filemtime() over file_exists() and filemtime() in some places. Reasons include
                - @filemtime() is almost twice as fast as using an additional file_exists()
                - between file_exists() and filemtime() a possible race condition is opened,
                  which does not exist using the simple @filemtime() approach.
