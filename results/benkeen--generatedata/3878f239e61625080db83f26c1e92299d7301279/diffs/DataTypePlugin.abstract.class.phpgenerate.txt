	/**
	 * The default constructor. Automatically populates the $L member var with whatever language is currently being
	 * used. If a Data Type uses its own constructor, it should always call the parent constructor as well, to ensure
	 * $L is populated. ( parent::__construct($runtimeContext); )
	 *
	 * @param string $content "ui" / "generation". Data Types are instantiated in one of two contexts: once when
	 *    the main UI page loads, so that the Data Type can be presented as an option for selection in the Data
	 *    Generator, and secondly when we're actually actually generating the results. It's sometimes beneficial
	 *    to only instantiate aspects of the class depending on the context.
