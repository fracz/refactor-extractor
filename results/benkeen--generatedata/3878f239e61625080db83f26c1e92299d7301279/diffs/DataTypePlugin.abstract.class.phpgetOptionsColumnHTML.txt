	 * Called during data generation. This determines what options the user selected in the user interface; it's
	 * used to figure out what settings to pass to each Data Type to provide that function the information needed
	 * to generate that particular data item.
	 *
	 * Note: if this function determines that the values entered by the user in the options column are invalid
	 * (most likely just incomplete) the function can explicitly return false to tell the core script to ignore
	 * this row.
	 *
	 * @param object $generator the instance of the Generator object, containing assorted public methods
	 * @param array $post the entire contents of $_POST
	 * @param integer the column number (*row* in the UI...!) of the item
	 * @param integer the number of columns in the data set
	 * @return mixed
	 *        - false, if the Data Type doesn't have sufficient information to generate the row (i.e. things weren't
	 *        filled in in the UI and the Data Type didn't add proper validation)
	 *        - anything else. This can be any data structure needed by the Data Type. It'll be passed as-is
	 *        into the generateItem function as the second parameter.
