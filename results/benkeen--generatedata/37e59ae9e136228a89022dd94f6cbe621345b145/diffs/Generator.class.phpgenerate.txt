	/**
	 * This function creates a "template" of the data set to be generated by passing off work to the
	 * various Data Types. The "template" that's returned is an ordered array of hashes, each hash being
	 * of the following structure:
	 *
	 *   array(
	 *      "title" => "", // whatever string is being used for the column title / node name / etc.
	 *      "type"  => "", // the namespace (folder name) of the Data Type
	 *      "options" => "" // whatever custom options have been specified for this Data Type
	 *      "has_dependencies" => ""  // boolean true / false. This is for Data Types whose generated content
	 *                                // (may) depend on values in other fields in the row, e.g. "Region",
	 *                                // which would need to know the randomly generated country to generate
	 *                                // an appropriate value
	 *   )
	 *
	 * The first two values are found right in the $_POST values, but the third and fourth are determined by
	 * the Data Type itself.
	 *
	 * @param array $hash
	 * @param integer $numCols
	 * @return array
