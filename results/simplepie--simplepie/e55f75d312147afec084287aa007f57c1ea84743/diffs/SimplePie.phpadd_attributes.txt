	/**
	 * Set the output encoding
	 *
	 * Allows you to override SimplePie's output to match that of your webpage.
	 * This is useful for times when your webpages are not being served as
	 * UTF-8.  This setting will be obeyed by {@see handle_content_type()}, and
	 * is similar to {@see set_input_encoding()}.
	 *
	 * It should be noted, however, that not all character encodings can support
	 * all characters.  If your page is being served as ISO-8859-1 and you try
	 * to display a Japanese feed, you'll likely see garbled characters.
	 * Because of this, it is highly recommended to ensure that your webpages
	 * are served as UTF-8.
	 *
	 * The number of supported character encodings depends on whether your web
	 * host supports {@link http://php.net/mbstring mbstring},
	 * {@link http://php.net/iconv iconv}, or both. See
	 * {@link http://simplepie.org/wiki/faq/Supported_Character_Encodings} for
	 * more information.
