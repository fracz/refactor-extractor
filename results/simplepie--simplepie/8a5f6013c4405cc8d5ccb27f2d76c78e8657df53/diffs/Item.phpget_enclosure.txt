	 * Grabs all available enclosures (podcasts, etc.)
	 *
	 * Supports the <enclosure> RSS tag, as well as Media RSS and iTunes RSS.
	 *
	 * At this point, we're pretty much assuming that all enclosures for an item are the same content.  Anything else is too complicated to properly support.
	 *
	 * @todo Add support for end-user defined sorting of enclosures by type/handler (so we can prefer the faster-loading FLV over MP4).
	 * @todo If an element exists at a level, but it's value is empty, we should fall back to the value from the parent (if it exists).
