    Handle the radio button case completely in the asap case (#8170)

    Instead of scheduling individual callbacks to asap, we schedule one and
    then do all the work in that one.

    I'm doing this for architectural refactoring reasons.

    Nevertheless, I'm adding a contrived unit test that this fixes. :)
