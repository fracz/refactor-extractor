    * WIP

    * fbjs support

    * WIP

    * dev/prod mode WIP

    * More WIP

    * builds a cjs bundle

    * adding forwarding modules

    * more progress on forwarding modules and FB config

    * improved how certain modules get inlined for fb and cjs

    * more forwarding modules

    * Fix forwarding module for ReactCurrentOwner

    * Revert "Add a lazy shim for ReactPerf"

    This reverts commit 723b402c07116a70ce8ff1e43a1f4d92052e8f43.

    * Change forwarding modules to import from -fb

    This is another, more direct fix for ReactPerf circular dependency

    * should fix fb and cjs bundles for ReactCurrentOwner

    * added provides module for ReactCurrentOwner

    * should improve console output

    * fixed typo with argument passing on functon call

    * Revert "should improve console output"

    This breaks the FB bundles.
