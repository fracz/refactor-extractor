    Attempt to simplify/fix warnAndMonitorForKeyUse

    I think completely removing warnAndMonitorForKeyUse is a bit difficult, without
    duplicating a ton of code. This at least ensures that the format string passed
    to `warning` is unique. Plus, because the FB internal code in question only
    matches the beginning of the format string, I think there should be zero
    internal changes that need to be made to support this refactor.
