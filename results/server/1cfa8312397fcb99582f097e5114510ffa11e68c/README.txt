    A first basic presentation app based on the amazing impress.js.
    You have to put a presentation file that contains the presentation defined in html into your ownCloud with the file extension .impress
    Then you can use this app to play it. It also contains a demo presentation that you can use to learn.
    Help is welcome to improve this app. :-)
