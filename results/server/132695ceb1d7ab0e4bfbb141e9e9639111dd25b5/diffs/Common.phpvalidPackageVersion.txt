    /**
     * Download a file through HTTP.  Considers suggested file name in
     * Content-disposition: header and can run a callback function for
     * different events.  The callback will be called with two
     * parameters: the callback type, and parameters.  The implemented
     * callback types are:
     *
     *  'setup'       called at the very beginning, parameter is a UI object
     *                that should be used for all output
     *  'message'     the parameter is a string with an informational message
     *  'saveas'      may be used to save with a different file name, the
     *                parameter is the filename that is about to be used.
     *                If a 'saveas' callback returns a non-empty string,
     *                that file name will be used as the filename instead.
     *                Note that $save_dir will not be affected by this, only
     *                the basename of the file.
     *  'start'       download is starting, parameter is number of bytes
     *                that are expected, or -1 if unknown
     *  'bytesread'   parameter is the number of bytes read so far
     *  'done'        download is complete, parameter is the total number
     *                of bytes read
     *  'connfailed'  if the TCP connection fails, this callback is called
     *                with array(host,port,errno,errmsg)
     *  'writefailed' if writing to disk fails, this callback is called
     *                with array(destfile,errmsg)
     *
     * If an HTTP proxy has been configured (http_proxy PEAR_Config
     * setting), the proxy will be used.
     *
     * @param string  $url       the URL to download
     * @param object  $ui        PEAR_Frontend_* instance
     * @param object  $config    PEAR_Config instance
     * @param string  $save_dir  (optional) directory to save file in
     * @param mixed   $callback  (optional) function/method to call for status
     *                           updates
     *
     * @return string  Returns the full path of the downloaded file or a PEAR
     *                 error on failure.  If the error is caused by
     *                 socket-related errors, the error object will
     *                 have the fsockopen error code available through
     *                 getCode().
     *
