     * Loads the scale's items into the $scale_items array.
     * There are three ways to achieve this:
     * 1. No argument given: The $scale string is already loaded and exploded to an array of items.
     * 2. A string is given: A comma-separated list of items is exploded into an array of items.
     * 3. An array of items is given and saved directly as the array of items for this scale.
     *
     * @param mixed $items Could be null, a string or an array. The method behaves differently for each case.
     * @return array The resulting array of scale items or null if the method failed to produce one.
