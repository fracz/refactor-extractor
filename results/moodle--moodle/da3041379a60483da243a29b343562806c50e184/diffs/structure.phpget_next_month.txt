     * Returns a formatted string that represents a date in user time
     * <b>WARNING: note that the format is for strftime(), not date().</b>
     * Because of a bug in most Windows time libraries, we can't use
     * the nicer %e, so we have to use %d which has leading zeroes.
     * A lot of the fuss in the function is just getting rid of these leading
     * zeroes as efficiently as possible.
     *
     * If parameter fixday = true (default), then take off leading
     * zero from %d, else maintain it.
     *
     * @param int $time the timestamp in UTC, as obtained from the database
     * @param string $format strftime format
     * @param int|float|string $timezone the timezone to use
     *        {@link http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Time_API#Timezone}
     * @param bool $fixday if true then the leading zero from %d is removed,
     *        if false then the leading zero is maintained
     * @param bool $fixhour if true then the leading zero from %I is removed,
     *        if false then the leading zero is maintained
     * @return string the formatted date/time
