     * Checks if a user can expand a course in the navigation.
     *
     * We use a cache here because in order to be accurate we need to call can_access_course which is a costly function.
     * Because this functionality is basic + non-essential and because we lack good event triggering this cache
     * permits stale data.
     * In the situation the user is granted access to a course after we've initialised this session cache the cache
     * will be stale.
     * It is brought up to date in only one of two ways.
     *   1. The user logs out and in again.
     *   2. The user browses to the course they've just being given access to.
     *
     * Really all this controls is whether the node is shown as expandable or not. It is uber un-important.
     *
     * @param stdClass $course
