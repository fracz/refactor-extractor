    MDL-41017 improve purify caching

    The improvements include:

    * HTMLPurifier cache is stored in localcachedir
    * allowobjectembed changes are not ignored any more
    * the cache keys include revision and all options which makes
      this suitable for local caches on cluster nodes
    * unchanged test is replaced by "true" value which should
      significantly improve performance
    * removal of purge_all_caches() hack for directory recreation
    * comments and coding style cleanup
