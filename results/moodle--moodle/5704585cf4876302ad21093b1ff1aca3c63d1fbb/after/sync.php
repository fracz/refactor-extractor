/**
 *
 * This script is meant to be called from a cronjob to sync moodle with the LDAP
 * backend in those setups where the LDAP backend acts as 'master' for enrolment.
 *
 * Example cron entry:
 * # 5 minutes past 4am
 * 5 4 * * * /usr/bin/php5 -c /etc/php5/cli/php.ini /var/www/moodle/enrol/ldap/cli/sync.php
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - If you have a large number of users, you may want to raise the memory limits
 *     by passing -d momory_limit=256M
 *   - For debugging & better logging, you are encouraged to use in the command line:
 *     -d log_errors=1 -d error_reporting=E_ALL -d display_errors=0 -d html_errors=0
 *
