    MDL-35356 improve worksheet exports

    This patch removes deprecated PEAR excel export lib in favour of newer PHPExcel,
    the ODS exporter implementation is finished and a test script is included.

    The default Excel format is now 2007, file extension is changed automatically
    to match excel format.
