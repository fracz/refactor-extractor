     * Calculates the skewness of the data distribution in the set
     * The skewness measures the degree of asymmetry of a distribution,

     * A normal distribution has a skewness = 0
     * A distribution with a tail off towards the high end of the scale
     * (positive skew) has a skewness > 0
     * A distribution with a tail off towards the low end of the scale
     * (negative skew) has a skewness < 0
     * Handles cummulative data sets correctly
