	 * Excel Function:

	 *
	 * @access	public
	 * @category Financial Functions
	 * @param	float	cost		Initial cost of the asset.
	 * @param	float	salvage		Value at the end of the depreciation.
	 *								(Sometimes called the salvage value of the asset)
	 * @param	integer	life		Number of periods over which the asset is depreciated.
	 *								(Sometimes called the useful life of the asset)
	 * @param	integer	period		The period for which you want to calculate the
	 *								depreciation. Period must use the same units as life.
	 * @param	float	factor		The rate at which the balance declines.
	 *								If factor is omitted, it is assumed to be 2 (the
