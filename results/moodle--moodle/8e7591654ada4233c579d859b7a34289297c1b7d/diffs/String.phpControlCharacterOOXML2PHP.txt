	 * Convert from PHP control character to OpenXML escaped control character
	 *
	 * Excel 2007 team:
	 * ----------------
	 * That's correct, control characters are stored directly in the shared-strings table.
	 * We do encode characters that cannot be represented in XML using the following escape sequence:
	 * _xHHHH_ where H represents a hexadecimal character in the character's value...
	 * So you could end up with something like _x0008_ in a string (either in a cell value (<v>)
	 * element or in the shared string <t> element.
	 *
	 * @param 	string	$value	Value to escape
	 * @return 	string
