	 * LOGICAL_OR
	 *
	 * Returns boolean TRUE if any argument is TRUE; returns FALSE if all arguments are FALSE.
	 *
	 * Excel Function:
	 *		=OR(logical1[,logical2[, ...]])
	 *
	 *		The arguments must evaluate to logical values such as TRUE or FALSE, or the arguments must be arrays
	 *			or references that contain logical values.
	 *
	 *		Boolean arguments are treated as True or False as appropriate
	 *		Integer or floating point arguments are treated as True, except for 0 or 0.0 which are False
	 *		If any argument value is a string, or a Null, the function returns a #VALUE! error, unless the string holds
	 *			the value TRUE or FALSE, in which case it is evaluated as the corresponding boolean value
	 *
	 * @access	public
	 * @category Logical Functions
	 * @param	mixed		$arg,...		Data values
	 * @return	boolean		The logical OR of the arguments.
