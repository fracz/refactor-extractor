	 *	ERF
	 *
	 *	Returns the error function integrated between the lower and upper bound arguments.
	 *
	 *	Note: In Excel 2007 or earlier, if you input a negative value for the upper or lower bound arguments,
	 *			the function would return a #NUM! error. However, in Excel 2010, the function algorithm was
	 *			improved, so that it can now calculate the function for both positive and negative ranges.
	 *			PHPExcel follows Excel 2010 behaviour, and accepts nagative arguments.
	 *
	 *	Excel Function:
	 *		ERF(lower[,upper])
	 *
	 *	@param	float		$lower	lower bound for integrating ERF
	 *	@param	float		$upper	upper bound for integrating ERF.
	 *								If omitted, ERF integrates between zero and lower_limit
	 *	@return	float
