	 * Handling of the SST continue blocks is complicated by the need to include an
	 * additional continuation byte depending on whether the string is split between
	 * blocks or whether it starts at the beginning of the block. (There are also
	 * additional complications that will arise later when/if Rich Strings are
	 * supported).
	 *
	 * The Excel documentation says that the SST record should be followed by an
	 * EXTSST record. The EXTSST record is a hash table that is used to optimise
	 * access to SST. However, despite the documentation it doesn't seem to be
	 * required so we will ignore it.
