	 *
	 * Returns the column number of the given cell reference
	 * If the cell reference is a range of cells, COLUMN returns the column numbers of each column in the reference as a horizontal array.
	 * If cell reference is omitted, and the function is being called through the calculation engine, then it is assumed to be the
	 *		reference of the cell in which the COLUMN function appears; otherwise this function returns 0.

	 *
	 * @param	cellAddress		A reference to a range of cells for which you want the column numbers
	 * @return	integer or array of integer
