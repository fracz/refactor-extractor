	 * Returns number rounded up to the nearest even integer.
	 * You can use this function for processing items that come in twos. For example,
	 *		a packing crate accepts rows of one or two items. The crate is full when
	 *		the number of items, rounded up to the nearest two, matches the crate's
	 *		capacity.
