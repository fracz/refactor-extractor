	/**
	 * CRITBINOM
	 *
	 * Returns the smallest value for which the cumulative binomial distribution is greater
	 *		than or equal to a criterion value
	 *
	 * See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/828117/ for details of the algorithm used
	 *
	 * @param	float		$trials			number of Bernoulli trials
	 * @param	float		$probability	probability of a success on each trial
	 * @param	float		$alpha			criterion value
	 * @return	int
	 *
	 * @todo	Warning. This implementation differs from the algorithm detailed on the MS
	 *			web site in that $CumPGuessMinus1 = $CumPGuess - 1 rather than $CumPGuess - $PGuess
	 *			This eliminates a potential endless loop error, but may have an adverse affect on the
	 *			accuracy of the function (although all my tests have so far returned correct results).
