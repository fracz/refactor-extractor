	/**
	 * DECTOBIN
	 *
	 * Return a decimal value as binary.
	 *
	 * Excel Function:
	 *		DEC2BIN(x[,places])
	 *
	 * @access	public
	 * @category Engineering Functions
	 * @param	string		$x		The decimal integer you want to convert. If number is negative,
	 *								valid place values are ignored and DEC2BIN returns a 10-character
	 *								(10-bit) binary number in which the most significant bit is the sign
	 *								bit. The remaining 9 bits are magnitude bits. Negative numbers are
	 *								represented using two's-complement notation.
	 *								If number < -512 or if number > 511, DEC2BIN returns the #NUM! error
	 *								value.
	 *								If number is nonnumeric, DEC2BIN returns the #VALUE! error value.
	 *								If DEC2BIN requires more than places characters, it returns the #NUM!
	 *								error value.
	 * @param	integer		$places	The number of characters to use. If places is omitted, DEC2BIN uses
	 *								the minimum number of characters necessary. Places is useful for
	 *								padding the return value with leading 0s (zeros).
	 *								If places is not an integer, it is truncated.
	 *								If places is nonnumeric, DEC2BIN returns the #VALUE! error value.
	 *								If places is zero or negative, DEC2BIN returns the #NUM! error value.
	 * @return	string
