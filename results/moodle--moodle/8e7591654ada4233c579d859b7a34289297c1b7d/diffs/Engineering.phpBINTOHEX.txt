	/**
	 * BINTOOCT
	 *
	 * Return a binary value as octal.
	 *
	 * Excel Function:
	 *		BIN2OCT(x[,places])
	 *
	 * @access	public
	 * @category Engineering Functions
	 * @param	string		$x		The binary number (as a string) that you want to convert. The number
	 *								cannot contain more than 10 characters (10 bits). The most significant
	 *								bit of number is the sign bit. The remaining 9 bits are magnitude bits.
	 *								Negative numbers are represented using two's-complement notation.
	 *								If number is not a valid binary number, or if number contains more than
	 *								10 characters (10 bits), BIN2OCT returns the #NUM! error value.
	 * @param	integer		$places	The number of characters to use. If places is omitted, BIN2OCT uses the
	 *								minimum number of characters necessary. Places is useful for padding the
	 *								return value with leading 0s (zeros).
	 *								If places is not an integer, it is truncated.
	 *								If places is nonnumeric, BIN2OCT returns the #VALUE! error value.
	 *								If places is negative, BIN2OCT returns the #NUM! error value.
	 * @return	string
