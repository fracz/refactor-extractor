	 * AMORDEGRC
	 *
	 * Returns the depreciation for each accounting period.
	 * This function is provided for the French accounting system. If an asset is purchased in
	 * the middle of the accounting period, the prorated depreciation is taken into account.
	 * The function is similar to AMORLINC, except that a depreciation coefficient is applied in
	 * the calculation depending on the life of the assets.
	 * This function will return the depreciation until the last period of the life of the assets
	 * or until the cumulated value of depreciation is greater than the cost of the assets minus
	 * the salvage value.
	 *
	 * Excel Function:
	 *		AMORDEGRC(cost,purchased,firstPeriod,salvage,period,rate[,basis])

	 * @param	float	cost		The cost of the asset.
	 * @param	mixed	purchased	Date of the purchase of the asset.
