    MDL-36135 Give the grading evaluation methods control over their settings forms

    From now on, the evaluator's method get_settings_form() should return a
    subclass of workshop_evaluation_settings_form. The evaluation subplugins
    are expected to use the define_sub() method to add their own fields into
    the base form, although they can override the main define() method, too.

    The former interface workshop_evaluation has been refactored into a
    superclass with abstract methods which seems to be more robust.

    Oh, by the way, I'm in Perth - yay!
