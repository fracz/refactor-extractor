    * MAJOR CHANGE: lang.php now uses two new core capabilities. With them, site admin may control who is able to edit master language packages (nobody by default) and who is able to customize local translation (legacy:admin by default). See MDL-10576 for details.
    * More GUI improvements and code cleaning
