    MDL-18375 calendar: huge refactor of the initial patch

    1) Moved the calendar types location to a sub-folder in the calendar directory.
    2) Removed/moved language strings.
    3) Removed calendar types that should be downloaded as plugins.
    4) Removed a Non-English language pack for the Gregorian calendar type that
    should be downloaded separately.
    5) Removed custom files responsible for checking for updates and uninstalling
    calendar types, which should be done by core.
    6) Removed JS from the calendar_month block as there is no non-JS alternative
    provided and the JS written does not make use of the YUI library to ensure
    multiple browser support.
    7) Removed code from the base class responsible for creating timestamps that
    are saved in the DB.
    8) Added PHPDocs.

    Note: In the original patch we are editing core functions responsible for saving
    time in the database in the calendar base class. This is very dangerous, we do
    not want to touch these functions as it could cause a complete fubar of the
    database. There are places we are forcing the use of the gregorian calendar as
    we are passing dates generated by the PHP date function, where as sometimes
    we pass dates from usergetdate (which was being overwritten to return the
    date specific to the calendar). We can not expect third party modules to
    change the calendar type depending on the format they pass to these functions.
