    MDL-57693 mod_lesson: Refactor to move code to lesson methods

    This is a big refactor to avoid code duplication in the new WS.
    Basically Iâ€™ve moved code from the page and renderer to the lesson
    class.
    New code is into methods, there are no code functionality changes (just
    minor fixes in comments).
