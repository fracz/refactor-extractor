<br />
I'm very proud that Moodle has been selected as one of only <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/projects.html">ten open source projects</a> to take part in the inaugural year of this new contest.<br />
<br />
We have a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-moodle/issues/list">long list of small tasks</a> prepared already for students, but we would definitely like to see the Moodle community come up with more - so if you have any ideas for things you want to see done, please <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-moodle/">send them to us</a>!  Just remember they can't take more than five days.<br />
<br />
Google will pay students US$100 for every three tasks they successfully complete, plus send a cool T-shirt.  There are also grand prizes including an all-expenses-paid trip to Google HQ in Mountain View, California.  If you are (or know) a young student with an interest in Moodle then give it a go! <br />
