    MDL-42711 import learnmoodle fixes: Fix the broken links in RSS feed block

    If the <description> of the feed contains URLs longer than 30 characters, the
    URL is split because of the break_up_long_words(). When combined with the
    filter that converts URLs to links, this produces broken links.

    The proper solution would be to improve break_up_long_words() so that it does
    not modifies URLs at all. As a temporary solution for our purpose now is to
    call format_text() prior to break_up_long_words() as it will not modify the
    inner content of the <a> tag.

    This should be fixed upstream. See also discussion at
