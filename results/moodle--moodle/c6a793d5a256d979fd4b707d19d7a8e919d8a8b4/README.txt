    MDL-37602 Put the overall feedback fields to the bottom of the assessment form

    The assessment form can be displayed as editable or read-only (frozen).
    Neither the editor element nor the filemanager element support
    displaying frozen content themselves so we need to pre-format and inject
    static texts.

    The list of attachments should be ideally generated by the renderer and
    probably improved a bit - just quick and dirty solution must be enough
    for now though (2.5 coding freeze is just behind the corner...).
