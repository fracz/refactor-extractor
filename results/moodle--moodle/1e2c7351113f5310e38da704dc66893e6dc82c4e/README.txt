    MDL-27376 MDL-27377 MDL-27378 Backup converters refactoring - work in progress

    These are David's changes of Mark's code that replace the
    plan/tasks/steps infrastructure with a bit simpler one. The changes will
    be described in the next commit that will actually finish the
    conversion.

    TODO: refactor backup/converter/moodle1/stepslib.php into conversion
    handlers.
