    Quiz refactoring is now merged into the main development code!

    I've done some basic testing using existing quizzes trying as
    much as I could think of, and it all worked well!

    Well done, Henrik!  Great job!

    Still, this should be regarded as unstable at least until more
    people have had a try.  Please test this thing solidly on new
    and old quizzes.
