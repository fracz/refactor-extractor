    Merging from STABLE:

    Converted the students table to use the new table class

    Fixed bug 3114: when sorting by country, prepend country code to the country name

    Fixed behavior of autohiding teacher list; now there is a hide/show icon to be
    consistent with the rest of Moodle

    Fixed "show all" option so that the user can control it instead of relying on auto behavior

    Fixed HTML, removed all inline styles

    Improved accessibility (alt tags for images)

    Updated obsolete optional_variable calls to optional_param

    Several cosmetic and other improvements I 've already forgotten :P
