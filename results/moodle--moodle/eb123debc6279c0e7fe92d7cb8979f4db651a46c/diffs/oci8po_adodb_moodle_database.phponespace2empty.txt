     * This function will handle all the records before being inserted/updated to DB for Oracle

     * equal to NULL and this presents a problem with all our currently NOT NULL default '' fields.
     *
     * Once Moodle DB will be free of this sort of false NOT NULLS, this hack could be removed safely
     *
     * Note that this function is 100% private and should be used, exclusively by DML functions
     * in this file. Also, this is considered a DIRTY HACK to be removed when possible. (stronk7)
