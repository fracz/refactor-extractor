  /**
   * Function Encoding::toUTF8
   *
   * This function leaves UTF8 characters alone, while converting almost all non-UTF8 to UTF8.
   *
   * It assumes that the encoding of the original string is either Windows-1252 or ISO 8859-1.
   *
   * It may fail to convert characters to UTF-8 if they fall into one of these scenarios:
   *
   * 1) when any of these characters:   ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖ×ØÙÚÛÜÝÞß
   *    are followed by any of these:  ("group B")
   *                                    ¡¢£¤¥¦§¨©ª«¬­®¯°±²³´µ¶•¸¹º»¼½¾¿
   * For example:   %ABREPRESENT%C9%BB. «REPRESENTÉ»
   * The "«" (%AB) character will be converted, but the "É" followed by "»" (%C9%BB)
   * is also a valid unicode character, and will be left unchanged.
   *
   * 2) when any of these: àáâãäåæçèéêëìíîï  are followed by TWO chars from group B,
   * 3) when any of these: ðñòó  are followed by THREE chars from group B.
   *
   * @name toUTF8
   * @param string $text  Any string.
   * @return string  The same string, UTF8 encoded
