	 * Identify an existing table alias that is compatible with the current
	 * query clause.
	 *
	 * We avoid unnecessary table joins by allowing each clause to look for
	 * an existing table alias that is compatible with the query that it
	 * needs to perform.
	 *
	 * An existing alias is compatible if (a) it is a sibling of `$clause`
	 * (ie, it's under the scope of the same relation), and (b) the combination
	 * of operator and relation between the clauses allows for a shared table join.
	 * In the case of {@see WP_Meta_Query}, this only applies to 'IN' clauses that
	 * are connected by the relation 'OR'.

	 * @param  array       $parent_query Parent query of $clause.
	 * @return string|bool Table alias if found, otherwise false.
