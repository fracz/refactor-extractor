    Importing the Further theme, first pass at the new default theme for 2014.

    A magazine theme with clean, responsive design focused on highlighting featured content prominently on home page.

    This is slated for 3.8. Development will occur in trunk for the theme, and in plugins for the nice-to-have features.

    Nice-to-have improvements include:

    - Add a Contributors page template to highlight authors.
    - Easy-to-manage featured content.
    - Add support for an Authors widget to highlight authors.

    Welcome, Twenty Fourteen n√© Further. Props iamtakashi, see #24858.
