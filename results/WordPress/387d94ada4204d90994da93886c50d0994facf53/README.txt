commit 387d94ada4204d90994da93886c50d0994facf53

    Themes: Update readme files.

    Adds information about changes in the current release, links to changlogs from
    previous releases, and improves links to use `https`.

    Release date for the latest versions will be August 18 even in the event of a
    delayed core release. Since all themes are backwards compatible we don't have
    a dependency there.

    Props mercime, davidakennedy.
    Fixes #32978.
