    REST API: Fix behavior of `sticky` posts filter when no posts are sticky.

    Previously, when getting posts from the API with `sticky=true`, if there were no sticky posts set, the query would return all posts  as if the `sticky` argument was not set.  In this situation, the query should return an empty array instead.

    A `sticky=true` query that should return an empty array (in the previous situation, or with `include` and no intersecting post IDs) was also broken in that it would query the post with ID 1.

    Finally, this commit significantly improves test coverage for the `sticky` filter argument, including direct testing of the `WHERE` clauses generated by `WP_Query`.

    Props ryelle.
    Fixes #39947.
