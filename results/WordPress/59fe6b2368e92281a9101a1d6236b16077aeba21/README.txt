    Lightly clean up and improve inline documentation in wp-config-sample.php.

    * Fixes some grammatical and wrapping issues in the file header, and breaks the contents list up into, well, a list.
    * Adds a note and Codex link to the DocBlock for the `WP_DEBUG` constant definition on where to find more information about constants used for debugging.

    Fixes #28551.
