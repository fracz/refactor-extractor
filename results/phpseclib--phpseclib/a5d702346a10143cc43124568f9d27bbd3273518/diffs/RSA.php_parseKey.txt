                   protect private keys, however, that's not what OpenSSL* does.  OpenSSL protects private keys by adding
                   two new "fields" to the key - DEK-Info and Proc-Type.  These fields are discussed here:

                   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421#section-4.6.1.1
                   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421#section-4.6.1.3

                   DES-EDE3-CBC as an algorithm, however, is not discussed anywhere, near as I can tell.
                   DES-CBC and DES-EDE are discussed in RFC1423, however, DES-EDE3-CBC isn't, nor is its key derivation
                   function.  As is, the definitive authority on this encoding scheme isn't the IETF but rather OpenSSL's
                   own implementation.  ie. the implementation *is* the standard and any bugs that may exist in that
                   implementation are part of the standard, as well.

                   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421#section-4.6.1.3

                   DES-EDE3-CBC as an algorithm, however, is not discussed anywhere, near as I can tell.
                   DES-CBC and DES-EDE are discussed in RFC1423, however, DES-EDE3-CBC isn't, nor is its key derivation
                   function.  As is, the definitive authority on this encoding scheme isn't the IETF but rather OpenSSL's
                   own implementation.  ie. the implementation *is* the standard and any bugs that may exist in that
                   implementation are part of the standard, as well.
