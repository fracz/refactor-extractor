    Fix support for stdClass classes (#595)

    Accessing a value from an stdClass instance with the Symfony property
    accessor will fail as the class has no public properties neither
    getters. Besides fixing that, the code has been refactored a bit to
    introduce a new property accessor properly supporting stdClass instances.
