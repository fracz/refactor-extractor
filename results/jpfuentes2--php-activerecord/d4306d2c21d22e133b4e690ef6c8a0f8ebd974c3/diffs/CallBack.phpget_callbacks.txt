	/**
	 * Invokes the callbacks for the specified $name.
	 *
	 * This is the only piece of the CallBack class that carries its own logic for the
	 * model object. For (after|before)_(create|update) callbacks, it will merge with
	 * a generic 'save' callback which is called first for the lease amount of precision.
	 *
	 * Returns null if no such name exists within the registry.
	 * Returns false if the following:
	 *  a method was invoked that was for a before_* callback and that
	 *  method returned false. If this happens, execution of any other callbacks after
	 *  the offending callback will not occur.
	 *
	 * @param string $model Model to invoke the callback on.
	 * @param string $name Name of the callback to invoke
	 * @param boolean $must_exist Set to true to raise an exception if the callback does not exist.
