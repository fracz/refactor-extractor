   * Log in a user with the internal browser.
   *
   * If a user is already logged in, then the current user is logged out before
   * logging in the specified user.
   *
   * Please note that neither the global $user nor the passed-in user object is
   * populated with data of the logged in user. If you need full access to the
   * user object after logging in, it must be updated manually. If you also need
   * access to the plain-text password of the user (set by drupalCreateUser()),
   * e.g. to log in the same user again, then it must be re-assigned manually.
   * For example:
   * @code
   *   // Create a user.
   *   $account = $this->drupalCreateUser(array());
   *   $this->drupalLogin($account);
   *   // Load real user object.
   *   $pass_raw = $account->pass_raw;
   *   $account = user_load($account->uid);
   *   $account->pass_raw = $pass_raw;
   * @endcode
   *
   * @param $user
   *   User object representing the user to log in.
   *
   * @see drupalCreateUser()
