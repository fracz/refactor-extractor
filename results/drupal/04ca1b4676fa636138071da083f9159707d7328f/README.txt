    #190283 by JirkaRybka and myself: fix installer localization and form handling
     - use a two pass localization process so localization is ready for the configure form and profile tasks
     - fix awkward form API workarounds which were introduced before we used a full bootstrap anyway
     - allow for more usable localized profiles by letting them skip language selection
     - lots of documentation improvements to profiles and the installer functions
