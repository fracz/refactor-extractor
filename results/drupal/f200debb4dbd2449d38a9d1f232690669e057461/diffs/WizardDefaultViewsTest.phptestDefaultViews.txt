  /**
   * Click a link to perform an operation on a view.
   *
   * In general, we expect lots of links titled "enable" or "disable" on the
   * various views listing pages, and they might have tokens in them. So we
   * need special code to find the correct one to click.
   *
   * @param $label
   *   Text between the anchor tags of the desired link.
   * @param $unique_href_part
   *   A unique string that is expected to occur within the href of the desired
   *   link. For example, if the link URL is expected to look like
   *   "admin/structure/views/view/frontpage/...", then "/frontpage/" could be
   *   passed as the expected unique string.
   *
   * @return
   *   The page content that results from clicking on the link, or FALSE on
   *   failure. Failure also results in a failed assertion.
