    - Patch #22215 by Richard Archer: refactored primary and secondary links.
      Deprecates the primary_links module.

      This patch was much needed.  Thanks Richards!

      NOTE: if some themers could investigate if there is room for improvement
            with regard to theming, that would be awesome.
