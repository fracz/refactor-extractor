   * In other words calling a settings page with $this->drupalPost() with a changed
   * value would update a variable to reflect that change, but in the thread that
   * made the call (thread running the test) the changed variable would not be
   * picked up.

   * to ensure that the most up-to-date set of variables is loaded.
