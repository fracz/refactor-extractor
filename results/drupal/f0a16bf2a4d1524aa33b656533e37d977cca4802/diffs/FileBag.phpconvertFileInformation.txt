     * Fixes a malformed PHP $_FILES array.
     *
     * PHP has a bug that the format of the $_FILES array differs, depending on
     * whether the uploaded file fields had normal field names or array-like
     * field names ("normal" vs. "parent[child]").
     *
     * This method fixes the array to look like the "normal" $_FILES array.
     *
     * It's safe to pass an already converted array, in which case this method
     * just returns the original array unmodified.
     *
     * @param  array $data
     * @return array
