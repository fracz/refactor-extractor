  /**
   * Gets the HTTP response headers of the requested page. Normally we are only
   * interested in the headers returned by the last request. However, if a page
   * is redirected or HTTP authentication is in use, multiple requests will be
   * required to retrieve the page. Headers from all requests may be requested
   * by passing TRUE to this function.
   *
   * @param $all_requests
   *   Boolean value specifying whether to return headers from all requests
   *   instead of just the last request. Defaults to FALSE.
   * @return
   *   A name/value array if headers from only the last request are requested.
   *   If headers from all requests are requested, an array of name/value
   *   arrays, one for each request.
   *
   *   The pseudonym ":status" is used for the HTTP status line.
   *
   *   Values for duplicate headers are stored as a single comma-separated list.
