    * Thoughts and `Why?'
      -------------------
      I created a sweet little class that is able to generate tiny calendars.
      98% of all portals (incl. big portals like slashdot and kuro5hin) lack
      a decent way to browse older stories that 'felt' of the news page.  At
      these sites, the only way to access older news is by using the search
      form which - I think - will only very few people tend to do.  If you do
      not know what you are searching for, this isn't very easy neither. As
      a consequence, older stories are often completly forgotten and
      discussions simply drop death as soon they felt of the main page.

      Many stories are actually timeless and can stay interesting and 'live'
      for a longer period of time.  By making them hard to access they are
      often killed before the discussion died peacefully on it's own.

      In other words:
      ---------------
      My calendar class is an attempt to make browsing archives (i.e. older
      stories) (a) possible and (b) easy to do ... and is hence considered a
      navigation improvement compared with the majority of all portals.
      IMHO, small improvements like these can and will make us better in the
      end.

      I suggest to integrate it on the main page if you all agree.  You can
      check a `demo' at
         http://beta.drop.org/calendar.class.php
      but be aware: it isn't linked with the database yet so you actually
      can't navigate anything yet.  ;)

    Throw in your 2 cents and let me know what you think of it please!
