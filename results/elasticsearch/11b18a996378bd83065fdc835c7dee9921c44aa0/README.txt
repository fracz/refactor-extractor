    Sort: Make ScoreSortBuilder implement NamedWriteable and add fromXContent parsing

    This change makes ScoreSortBuilder implement NamedWriteable, adds
    equals() and hashCode() and also implements parsing ScoreSortBuilder
    back from xContent. This is needed for the ongoing Search refactoring.
