    RescoreBuilder: Add parsing and creating of RescoreSearchContext

    Adding the ability to parse from xContent to the rescore builder. Also making RescoreBuilder an abstract base class that encapsulates the window_size setting, with QueryRescoreBuilder as its only implementation at the moment.

    Relates to #15559
