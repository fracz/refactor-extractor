    Geo: Moving static factory methods to ShapeBuilders

    Currently the abstract ShapeBuilder class serves too many different
    purposes, making it hard to refactor and maintain the code. In order
    to reduce the size and responsibilities, this PR moved all the
    static factory methods used as a shortcut to create new shape builders
    out to a new ShapeBuilders class, similar to how QueryBuilders is
    used already.
