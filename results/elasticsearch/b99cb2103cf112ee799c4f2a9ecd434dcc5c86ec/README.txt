    Query Refactoring: Add RangeQueryBuilder and Parser refactoring and test.

    Split the parse(QueryParseContext ctx) method into a parsing and a query building part,
    adding Streamable support for serialization and hashCode(), equals() for better testing.

    This PR also adds test setup for two mappes fields (integer, date) to the BaseQueryTestCase
    and introduces helper methods for optional conversion of String fields to BytesRef representation
    that is shared with the already refactored BaseTermQueryBuilder.

    Relates to #10217
    Closes #11108
