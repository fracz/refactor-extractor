commit ad52ac4f88b37c47b9cc4a37df85080669552ad5
Author: Jonathan Stanley <shs@users.sourceforge.net>

    A couple changes to improve usability:

    1) Reworded the "Install missing" explain for the converter
    2) "Forked" the final page of a clean install to give two options... #1 being going to the convertor and #2 being the already existing "Take me to your ACP!" stuff.

    Shouldn't have broken anything else, though the i18n/L10n lot will need to update their strings for this. ;)
