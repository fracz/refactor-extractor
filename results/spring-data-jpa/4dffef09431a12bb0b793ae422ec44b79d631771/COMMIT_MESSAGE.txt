    DATAJPA-348 - Extending workaround for HHH-6951.

    We're now using AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation(â€¦) in case of Hibernate to improve workaround for HHH-6951. Added id type caching as the annotation lookup is potentially expensive.

    Added integration tests for Hibernate and EclipseLink.
