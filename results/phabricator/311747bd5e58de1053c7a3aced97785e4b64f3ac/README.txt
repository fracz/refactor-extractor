    Change CLOSED colors to Indigo over Black

    Summary: CLosed is a pretty important state and black tends to blend in a bit. This bumps to an alternate color to improve ability to scan and know state of objects.

    Test Plan:
    Review a number of closed objects. I will follow up with another diff on 'Archived' colors.
