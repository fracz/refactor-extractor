   * In Gmail, conversations will be broken if you reply to a thread and the
   * server sends back a response without referencing your Message-ID, even if
   * it references a Message-ID earlier in the thread. To avoid this, use the
   * parent email's message ID explicitly if it's available. This overwrites the
   * "In-Reply-To" and "References" headers we would otherwise generate. This
   * needs to be set whenever an action is triggered by an email message. See
   * T251 for more details.
   *
   * @param   string The "Message-ID" of the email which precedes this one.
