    Rough cut of Project profile improvements

    Summary:
      - Old page was useless and dumb.
      - New page looks a little less bad, functions a little less poorly.
      - Still lots of work to be done.

    Test Plan:
      - Viewed a project.
      - Clicked all the links on the left nav.
      - Here is a screenshot:
