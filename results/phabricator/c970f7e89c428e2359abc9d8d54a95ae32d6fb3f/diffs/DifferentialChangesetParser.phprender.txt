   * Mask - compute the actual lines that need to be shown (because they
   * are near changes lines, near inline comments, or the request has
   * explicitly asked for them, i.e. resulting from the user clicking
   * "show more"). The $mask returned is a sparesely populated dictionary
   * of $visible_line_number => true.
   *
   * Depths - compute how indented any given line is. The $depths returned
   * is a sparesely populated dictionary of $visible_line_number => $depth.

   * This function also has the side effect of modifying member variable
   * new such that tabs are normalized to spaces for each line of the diff.
