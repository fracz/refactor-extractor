  /**
   * Highly specialized cache for performing setup checks. We use this cache
   * to determine if we need to run expensive setup checks when the page
   * loads. Without it, we would need to run these checks every time.
   *
   * Normally, this cache is just APC. In the absence of APC, this cache
   * degrades into a slow, quirky on-disk cache.
   *
   * NOTE: Do not use this cache for anything else! It is not a general-purpose
   * cache!
   *
   * @return PhutilKeyValueCacheStack Most qualified available cache stack.
