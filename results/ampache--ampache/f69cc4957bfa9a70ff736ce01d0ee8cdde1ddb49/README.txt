    Translation update + improvement

    + German and French translation updated due to latest changes.
    + Other
    languages updated to latest state via `gather-messages.sh`
    + Small
    improvement arount line 286 in `templates/header.inc.php`. I think it's
    better to have one coherent sentence because to translate
    one sentence
    in pieces is slightly confusing.

    :-)
