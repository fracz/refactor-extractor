 * Linker rule instructing the linker to replace a given field's contents with a Descriptor.

 * This rule inspects a given field of the the provided Descriptor and attempts to determine whether this is a FQSEN
 * by reading the first character. If the first character is a backslash ('\') than a FQSEN is assumed and this rule
 * will attempt to find the given FQSEN in the 'elements' index of the ProjectDescriptor.
 *
 * This rule may declare which type of element is intended, if it is provided than a parser error must be given if an
 * element is found in the 'elements' index but it does not match the intended type.
 *
 * If the field contents is not an FQSEN or the element is not found, the contents are left unchanged so that they may
 * be interpreted by the router during the building of the templates.
