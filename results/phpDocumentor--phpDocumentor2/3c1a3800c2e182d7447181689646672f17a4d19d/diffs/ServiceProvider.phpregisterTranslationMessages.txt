     * In every template we use PHP helpers in order to be able to have routing that is universal between templates and
     * convert Markdown text into HTML (for example). The only way for XSL to do this is by having global functions or
     * static methods in a class because you cannot inject an object into an XSL processor.
     *
     * With this method we make sure that all dependencies used by the static methods are injected as static properties.
