    feature(groups): group owner transfer lists users alphabetically

    When you wish to transfer the ownership of a large group it could be
    hard to find the new owner as there was no sorting. Now users are listed
    alphabetically.

    We donâ€™t create full ElggUser objects for improved performance.
