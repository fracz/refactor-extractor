	/**
	 * Count the number of bytes in a string
	 *
	 * We cannot simply use strlen() for this, because it might be overwritten by the mbstring extension.
	 * In this case, strlen() will count the number of *characters* based on the internal encoding. A
	 * sequence of bytes might be regarded as a single multibyte character.
	 *
	 * Use elgg_strlen() to count UTF-characters instead of bytes.
	 *
	 * @param string $binary_string The input string
	 *
	 * @return int The number of bytes
