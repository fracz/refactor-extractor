	 * Should the run() method receive an offset representing all processed items?
	 *
	 * If true, run() will receive as $offset the number of items already processed. This is useful
	 * if you are only modifying data, and need to use the $offset in a function like elgg_get_entities*()
	 * to know how many to skip over.
	 *
	 * If false, run() will receive as $offset the total number of failures. This should be used if your
	 * process deletes or moves data out of the way of the process. E.g. if you delete 50 objects on each
	 * run(), you may still use the $offset to skip objects that already failed once.
