     * This method returns an Association object from storage that
     * matches the server URL and, if specified, handle. It returns
     * null if no such association is found or if the matching
     * association is expired.
     *
     * If no handle is specified, the store may return any association
     * which matches the server URL. If multiple associations are
     * valid, the recommended return value for this method is the one
     * most recently issued.
     *
     * This method is allowed (and encouraged) to garbage collect
     * expired associations when found. This method must not return
     * expired associations.
     *
     * @param string $server_url The URL of the identity server to get
     * the association for. Because of the way the server portion of
     * the library uses this interface, don't assume there are any
     * limitations on the character set of the input string.  In
     * particular, expect to see unescaped non-url-safe characters in
     * the server_url field.
     *
     * @param mixed $handle This optional parameter is the handle of
     * the specific association to get. If no specific handle is
     * provided, any valid association matching the server URL is
     * returned.
     *
     * @return Association The Association for the given identity
     * server.
