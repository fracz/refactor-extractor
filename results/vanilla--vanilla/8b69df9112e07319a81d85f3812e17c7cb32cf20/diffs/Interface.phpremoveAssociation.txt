     * Called when using a nonce.
     *
     * This method should return C{True} if the nonce has not been
     * used before, and store it for a while to make sure nobody
     * tries to use the same value again.  If the nonce has already
     * been used, return C{False}.
     *
     * Change: In earlier versions, round-trip nonces were used and a
     * nonce was only valid if it had been previously stored with
     * storeNonce.  Version 2.0 uses one-way nonces, requiring a
     * different implementation here that does not depend on a
     * storeNonce call.  (storeNonce is no longer part of the
     * interface.
     *
     * @param string $nonce The nonce to use.
     *
     * @return bool Whether or not the nonce was valid.
