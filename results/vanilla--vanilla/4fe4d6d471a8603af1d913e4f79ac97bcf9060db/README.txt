    Simplify the request parsing logic a bit

    There are two main changes here:

    1. Check for X_REWRITE first since that is the situation a properly configured installation will have. If X_REWRITE is found then donâ€™t check $_GET for a path argument.

    2. Remove some redundant logic when parsing the $_GET that was probably a result of previous refactoring.
