    * This is the canonical, e.g., official, list of emoji names along with

    * names visit http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/ and for the original image
    * files being used, visit https://github.com/taninamdar/Apple-Color-Emoji
    *
    * Note: every canonical emoji name points to an array of strings. This
    * string is ordered CurrentName, OriginalName. Due to the reset()
    * before returning the filename, the first element in the array will be
    * returned, so in this instance CurrentName will be returned. The second,
    * OriginalName, does not have to be written. If ever integrating more emoji
    * files from Apple-Color-Emoji, and wanting to rename them from numbered
    * files, use emojirename.php located in design/images/emoji/.
    *
    * @param type $emojiCanonical Optional string to return matching file name.
    * @return string|array File name or full canonical array
