    Fix asset sorting

    The dispatcher refactor assigns a lowercased application name to the controller rather than the title cased one. This causes the asset sort arrays to not work. Rather that changing the application thatâ€™s assigned to the dispatcher I opted to make the asset sort containers case-insensitive.

    This PR also includes some variable renaming to be in line with code standards.
