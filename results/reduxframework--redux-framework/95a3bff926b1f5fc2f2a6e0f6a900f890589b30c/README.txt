    * Modified:   Typography field CSS completely rewritten. All thanks to @eplanetdesign!
    * Modified:   Validation now works in metaboxes as well as updates numbers as changes occur. Validation for subsections is SO hot now.
    * Modified:   Various CSS fixes and improvements.
    * Fixed:      3+ JavaScript errors found in the background field. Now works flawlessly.
    * Added:      disable_save_warn flags to the arguments to disable the "you should save" slidedown.
