    /**
     * Decorates a PHP variable with something that will escape any data obtained
     * from it.
     *
     * The following cases are dealt with:
     *
     *    - The value is null or false: null or false is returned.
     *    - The value is scalar: the result of applying the escaping method is
     *      returned.
     *    - The value is an array or an object that implements the ArrayAccess
     *      interface: the array is decorated such that accesses to elements yield
     *      an escaped value.
     *    - The value implements the Traversable interface (either an Iterator, an
     *      IteratorAggregate or an internal PHP class that implements
     *      Traversable): decorated much like the array.
     *    - The value is another type of object: decorated such that the result of
     *      method calls is escaped.
     *
     * The escaping method is actually a PHP callable. This class hosts a set
     * of standard escaping strategies.
     *
     * @param  string $escaper The escaping method (a PHP callable) to apply to the value
     * @param  mixed  $value   The value to escape
     *
     * @return mixed Escaped value
     *
     * @throws \InvalidArgumentException If the escaping fails
