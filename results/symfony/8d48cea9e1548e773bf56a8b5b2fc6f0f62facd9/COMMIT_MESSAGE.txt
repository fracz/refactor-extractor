    [EventDispatcher] Change the license of EventDispatcher from LGPL to MIT

    It was previously agreed to re-license the Doctrine2 based
    EventDispatcher refactoring to use the MIT license. However, the files
    still retain the LGPL license notice.

    This commit changes the license to MIT.
