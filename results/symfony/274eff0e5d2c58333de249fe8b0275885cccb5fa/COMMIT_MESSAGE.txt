    [EventDispatcher] Change the license of EventDispatcher from LGPL to MIT

    It was previously agreed to re-license the Doctrine2 based
    EventDispatcher refactoring to use the MIT license. However, the files
    still retain the LGPL license notice.

    This commit changes the license to MIT.

    That's right but I would prefer that the PR comes from someone of the Doctrine core team like @beberlei or @jwage.

    or at least, they can perhaps acknowledge this PR.
