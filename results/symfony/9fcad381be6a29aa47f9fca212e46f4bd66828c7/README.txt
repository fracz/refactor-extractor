    Reading our blog about hhvm (http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-3-achieves-100-hhvm-compatibility)
    I'd like to improve the only single test skip in our code base that exists for hhvm.

    HHVM does not trigger strict notices. This is a missing feature of the HHVM parser (https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/5583). But this does not affect in any way the behavior of any PHP app. Strict notices are only for the dev stage.

    There is some FUD-friendliness in the article and in the comments (no offence @javiereguiluz â˜®):
    100% hhvm compat is 100% honest. We did not skip any single tests because of errors, issues nor bugs. And the single missing "feature" of hhvm is this one: strict notices. Kudos to hhvm for what they did: parity is close enough so that the delta can be handled in exactly the same way as we handle deltas between PHP versions.
