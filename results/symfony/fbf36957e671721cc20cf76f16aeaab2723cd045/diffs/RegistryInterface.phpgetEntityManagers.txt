     * Resets a named entity manager.

     * This method is useful when an entity manager has been closed
     * because of a rollbacked transaction AND when you think that
     * it makes sense to get a new one to replace the closed one.
     *
     * Be warned that you will get a brand new entity manager as
     * the existing one is not useable anymore. This means that any
     * other object with a dependency on this entity manager will
     * hold an obsolete reference. You can inject the registry instead
     * to avoid this problem.
     *
     * @param string $name The entity manager name (null for the default one)
