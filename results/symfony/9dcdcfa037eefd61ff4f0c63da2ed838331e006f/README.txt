    Todo: -

    Adds support for PATCH method. Accidentally I refactored the test RequestTest a bit to verify PUT, DELETE and PATCH and not only PUT.

    Why do you classify this as something that breaks backwards compatibility? I don't think it breaks anything.

    Itâ€™s not that relevant here, but before using patch throws an exception which it no longer does.

    Maybe you can update the [DomCrawler](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/DomCrawler/Form.php) at the same time ?
