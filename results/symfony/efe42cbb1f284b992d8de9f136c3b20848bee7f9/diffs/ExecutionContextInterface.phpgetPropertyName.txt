||||||||    public function getPropertyName();

    /**
     * Returns the property path to the value that the validator is currently
     * validating.
     *
     * For example, take the following object graph:
     *
     * <pre>
     * (Person)---($address: Address)---($street: string)
     * </pre>
     *
     * When the <tt>Person</tt> instance is passed to the validator, the
     * property path is initially empty. When the <tt>$address</tt> property
     * of that person is validated, the property path is "address". When
     * the <tt>$street</tt> property of the related <tt>Address</tt> instance
     * is validated, the property path is "address.street".
     *
     * Properties of objects are prefixed with a dot in the property path.
     * Indices of arrays or objects implementing the {@link \ArrayAccess}
     * interface are enclosed in brackets. For example, if the property in
     * the previous example is <tt>$addresses</tt> and contains an array
     * of <tt>Address</tt> instance, the property path generated for the
     * <tt>$street</tt> property of one of these addresses is for example
     * "addresses[0].street".
     *
     * @param string $subPath Optional. The suffix appended to the current
     *                        property path.
     *
     * @return string The current property path. The result may be an empty
     *                string if the validator is currently validating the
     *                root value of the validation graph.
