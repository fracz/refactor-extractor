    /**
     * Initializes the built-in escapers.
     *
     * Each function specifies a way for applying a transformation to a string
     * passed to it. The purpose is for the string to be "escaped" so it is
     * suitable for the format it is being displayed in.
     *
     * For example, the string: "It's required that you enter a username & password.\n"
     * If this were to be displayed as HTML it would be sensible to turn the
     * ampersand into '&amp;' and the apostrophe into '&aps;'. However if it were
     * going to be used as a string in JavaScript to be displayed in an alert box
     * it would be right to leave the string as-is, but c-escape the apostrophe and
     * the new line.
     *
     * For each function there is a define to avoid problems with strings being
     * incorrectly specified.
