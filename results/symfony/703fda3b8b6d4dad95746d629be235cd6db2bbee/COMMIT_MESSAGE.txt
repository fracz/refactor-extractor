    I marked this PR as a BC break, as it breaks the xml schema generated by the command __app/console list --xml__

    It replaces the first node (currently _symfony_) by a more generic node name ( _application_ ) and adds the application name and application version if specified in the _Symfony\Component\Console\Application_ constructor.

    Before (using composer console that uses symfony console component):
    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <symfony>
        ...
    </symfony>
    ```

    After (using composer console that uses symfony console component):
    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <application name="Composer" version="x.x.x">
        ...
    </application>
    ```
