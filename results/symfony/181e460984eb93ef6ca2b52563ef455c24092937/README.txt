    This PR optimizes the creation of dumped containers drastically (thanks @jpauli for the hint).

    The Container class generated by the PHP dumper does not include the `getDefaultParameters()` method anymore. It does not seem like a big deal to me as I fail to see a use case where someone would override this method.
