    [WIP][SecurityBundle] Added a way to extend the providers section of the config

    Bug fix: no
    Feature addition: yes
    BC break: <del>no (for now)</del> yes
    Tests pass: yes

    This adds a way to extend the ``providers`` section of the security config so that other bundles can hook their stuff into it. An example is available in DoctrineBundle which is now responsible to handle the entity provider (<del>needs some cleanup as the service definition is still in SecurityBundle currently</del>). This will allow PropelBundle to provide a ``propel:`` provider for instance.

    In order to keep BC with the existing configuration for the in-memory and the chain providers, I had to allow using a prototyped node instead of forcing using an array node with childrens. This introduces some issues:

    - impossible to validate easily that a provider uses only one setup as prototyped node always have a default value (the empty array)
    - the ``getFixableKey`` method is needed in the interface to support the XML format by pluralizing the name.

    Here is my non-BC proposal for the configuration to clean this:

    ```yaml
    security:
        providers:
            first:
                memory: # BC break here by adding a level before the users
                    users:
                         joe: { password: foobar, roles: ROLE_USER }
                         john: { password: foobarbaz, roles: ROLE_USER }
            second:
                entity: # this one is BC
                    class: Acme\DemoBundle\Entity\User
            third:
                id: my_custom_provider # also BC
            fourth:
                chain: # BC break by adding a level before the providers
                     providers: [first, second, third]
    ```

    What do you think about it ? Do we need to keep the BC in the config of the bundle or no ?

    Btw note that the way to register the factories used by the firewall section should be refactored using the new way to provide extension points in the extensions (as done here) instead of relying on the end user to register factories, which would probably mean a BC break anyway.

    i don't think we should keep BC. the security config is complex as is .. having BC stuff in there will just make it even harder and confusing.

    Is the security component tagged with `@api` ?

    So basically, we just have to create a factory (`ModelFactory` for instance) and to register it in the `security` extension, right ? Seems quite simple to extend and much better than the hardcoded versionâ€¦

    Why did you call the method to pluralize a key `getFixableKey` ?

    Changing security config will introduce risk for users. We should avoid that

    @beberlei as the config is validated, it will simply give them an exception during the loading of the config if they don't update their config.

    @schmittjoh @fabpot Could you give your mind about it ?

    I updated the PR by implementing my proposal as the latest IRC meeting agreed that we don't need to keep the BC for this change. This allows to add the validation rule now.

    @stof: Before merging, you must also add information about how to upgrade in the CHANGELOG-2.1.md file.
