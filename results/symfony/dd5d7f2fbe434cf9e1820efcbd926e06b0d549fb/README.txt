    [WIP] Fixed ACL handling of Doctrine proxies

    Bug fix: yes
    Feature addition: no
    Backwards compatibility break: no
    Symfony2 tests pass: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jalliot/symfony.png?branch=acl_proxies-2)](http://travis-ci.org/jalliot/symfony)
    Fixes the following tickets: #3818, #2611, #2056, #2048, #2035 and probably others
    Todo: Fix tests, update changelog

    Hi,

    As per @fabpot's request, here is #3818 ported to `master`.

    > Here is a new attempt to fix all the issues related to Symfony ACL identities and Doctrine proxies.
    > It only fixes the issue for Doctrine >=2.2 (older versions of Doctrine will still not work properly with ACL because `Doctrine\Common\Util\ClassUtils` didn't exist before and proxy naming strategy was not consistent between all Doctrine implementations (ORM/ODM/etc.)).

    I'm -1 on adding a dependency on the Doctrine class.

    The naming scheme was designed in a generic way, we should just copy the method.

    @schmittjoh The ACL component requires Doctrine DBAL already (and as such Common) so I don't think this is really an issue at the moment. If (when?) the component is refactored to be decoupled from Doctrine, then maybe we will have to change that.
    But I can also copy the class (where?) if you think it is better :)

    I'd suggest ``Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Util\ClassUtils``.

    @fabpot @schmittjoh It's done: I've backported the ClassUtils class and its tests from Doctrine Common into the Security component. Maybe this PR can be merged into 2.0 as well now, what do you think?

    There seems to be a consensus that ACLs donâ€™t (fully?) work with Doctrine < 2.2, i.e. in Symfony 2.0. Can it therefore be documented somewhere, typically on the main documentation page on the subject? http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/acl.html

    @oscherler You can make ACL work with Doctrine < 2.2 and without this patch if you use something like this code (note this is for ORM only but it can be adapted for ODM; it also assumes that your identifier can be retrieved with `getId()`):

    ``` php
    <?php

    use Doctrine\ORM\Proxy\Proxy;
    use Symfony\Component\Acl\Domain\ObjectIdentity;

    $domainObject = ... // some Doctrine entity (maybe a proxy...)

    if ($domainObject instanceof Proxy) {
        $objectIdentity = new ObjectIdentity($domainObject->getId(), get_parent_class($domainObject));
    } else {
        $objectIdentity = new ObjectIdentity($domainObject->getId(), get_class($domainObject));
    }
    ```
    It is ugly but it is the only way to get the correct identity for < 2.2. Never use `ObjectIdentity::fromDomainObject` with a proxy and without this patch!
    The same applies to `UserSecurityIdentity`.

    This should indeed be documented in the doc for 2.0. /cc @weaverryan

    I just fixed the tests and squashed the commits.
    I didn't write a test for `UserSecurityIdentity::fromAccount` and `fromToken` because I didn't really have time to look for a clean solution (without creating a full UserInterface implementation for instance...). Anyway the test for `ObjectIdentity::fromDomainObject` should be enough I guess...
    Don't hesitate to add one if you think it is necessary. /cc @schmittjoh

    @fabpot Apart from @beberlei approval to use MIT license, I think it is ready for merge.
