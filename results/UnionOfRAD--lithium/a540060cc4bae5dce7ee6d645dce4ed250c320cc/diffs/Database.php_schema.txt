	 *
	 * - If `$key` is numeric and `$value` is a string, `$value` is treated as a literal SQL
	 *   fragment and returned.
	 *
	 * @param string|array $conditions The conditions for this query.
	 * @param object $context The current `lithium\data\model\Query` instance.
	 * @param array $options
	 *               - `prepend` _boolean_: Whether the return string should be prepended with the
	 *                 `WHERE` keyword.
	 * @return string Returns the `WHERE` clause of an SQL query.
