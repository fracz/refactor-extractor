     * Parse the JSON response body and return the JSON decoded data.
     *
     * @param array $config Associative array of configuration settings used
     *     to control how the JSON data is parsed. Concrete implementations MAY
     *     add further configuration settings as needed, but they MUST implement
     *     functionality for the following options:
     *
     *     - object: Set to true to parse JSON objects as PHP objects rather
     *       than associative arrays. Defaults to false.
     *     - big_int_strings: When set to true, large integers are converted to
     *       strings rather than floats. Defaults to false.
     *
     *     Implementations are free to add further configuration settings as
     *     needed.
     *
     * @return mixed Returns the JSON decoded data based on the provided
     *     parse settings.
     * @throws \RuntimeException if the response body is not in JSON format
