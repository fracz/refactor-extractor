	/**
	 * Sets the font used to print character strings.
	 * The font can be either a standard one or a font added via the AddFont() method. Standard fonts use Windows encoding cp1252 (Western Europe).
	 * The method can be called before the first page is created and the font is retained from page to page.
	 * If you just wish to change the current font size, it is simpler to call SetFontSize().
	 * Note: for the standard fonts, the font metric files must be accessible. There are three possibilities for this:<ul><li>They are in the current directory (the one where the running script lies)</li><li>They are in one of the directories defined by the include_path parameter</li><li>They are in the directory defined by the K_PATH_FONTS constant</li></ul><br />
	 * @param $family (string) Family font. It can be either a name defined by AddFont() or one of the standard Type1 families (case insensitive):<ul><li>times (Times-Roman)</li><li>timesb (Times-Bold)</li><li>timesi (Times-Italic)</li><li>timesbi (Times-BoldItalic)</li><li>helvetica (Helvetica)</li><li>helveticab (Helvetica-Bold)</li><li>helveticai (Helvetica-Oblique)</li><li>helveticabi (Helvetica-BoldOblique)</li><li>courier (Courier)</li><li>courierb (Courier-Bold)</li><li>courieri (Courier-Oblique)</li><li>courierbi (Courier-BoldOblique)</li><li>symbol (Symbol)</li><li>zapfdingbats (ZapfDingbats)</li></ul> It is also possible to pass an empty string. In that case, the current family is retained.
	 * @param $style (string) Font style. Possible values are (case insensitive):<ul><li>empty string: regular</li><li>B: bold</li><li>I: italic</li><li>U: underline</li><li>D: line through</li><li>O: overline</li></ul> or any combination. The default value is regular. Bold and italic styles do not apply to Symbol and ZapfDingbats basic fonts or other fonts when not defined.
	 * @param $size (float) Font size in points. The default value is the current size. If no size has been specified since the beginning of the document, the value taken is 12
	 * @param $fontfile (string) The font definition file. By default, the name is built from the family and style, in lower case with no spaces.
	 * @param $subset (mixed) if true embedd only a subset of the font (stores only the information related to the used characters); if false embedd full font; if 'default' uses the default value set using setFontSubsetting(). This option is valid only for TrueTypeUnicode fonts. If you want to enable users to change the document, set this parameter to false. If you subset the font, the person who receives your PDF would need to have your same font in order to make changes to your PDF. The file size of the PDF would also be smaller because you are embedding only part of a font.
	 * @param $out (boolean) if true output the font size command, otherwise only set the font properties.
