    Fix PHP Notices: Reduce error log noise

    While DokuWiki suppresses PHP Notices they are still a code smell and
    should be fixed. This fixes some PHP Notices that occurred.

    Some of these fixes could be refactored into nicer code once we move to
    PHP 7 and get access to the `??` operator.
