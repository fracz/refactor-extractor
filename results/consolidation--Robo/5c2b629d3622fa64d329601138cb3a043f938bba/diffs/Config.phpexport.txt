     * Given an object that contains configuration methods, inject any
     * configuration found in the configuration file.
     *
     * The proper use for this method is to call setter methods of the
     * provided object. Using configuration to call methods that do work
     * is an abuse of this mechanism.
     *
     * TODO: We could use reflection to test to see if the return type
     * of the provided object is a reference to the object itself. All
     * setter methods should do this. This test is insufficient to guarentee
     * that the method is valid, but it would catch almost every misuse.
