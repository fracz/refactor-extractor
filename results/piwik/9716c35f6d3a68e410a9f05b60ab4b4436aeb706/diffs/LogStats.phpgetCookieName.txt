	/**
	 * This methods tries to see if the visitor has visited the website before.
	 *
	 * We have to split the visitor into one of the category
	 * - Known visitor
	 * - New visitor
	 *
	 * A known visitor is a visitor that has already visited the website in the current month.
	 * We define a known visitor using the algorithm:
	 *
	 * 1) Checking if a cookie contains
	 * 		// a unique id for the visitor
	 * 		- id_visitor
	 *
	 * 		// the timestamp of the last action in the most recent visit
	 * 		- timestamp_last_action
	 *
 	 *  	// the timestamp of the first action in the most recent visit
	 * 		- timestamp_first_action
	 *
	 * 		// the ID of the most recent visit (which could be in the past or the current visit)
	 * 		- id_visit
	 *
	 * 		// the ID of the most recent action
	 * 		- id_last_action
	 *
	 * 2) If the visitor doesn't have a cookie, we try to look for a similar visitor configuration.
	 * 	  We search for a visitor with the same plugins/OS/Browser/Resolution for today for this website.
