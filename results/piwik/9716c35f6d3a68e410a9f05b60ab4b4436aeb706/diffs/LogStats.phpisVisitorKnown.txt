	 * Once we have the visitor information, we have to define if the visit is a new or a known visit.
	 *
	 * 1) When the last action was done more than 30min ago,
	 * 	  or if the visitor is new, then this is a new visit.
	 *
	 * 2) If the last action is less than 30min ago, then the same visit is going on.
	 *	Because the visit goes on, we can get the time spent during the last action.
	 *
	 * NB:
	 *  - In the case of a new visit, then the time spent
	 *	during the last action of the previous visit is unknown.
	 *
	 *	- In the case of a new visit but with a known visitor,
	 *	we can set the 'returning visitor' flag.
