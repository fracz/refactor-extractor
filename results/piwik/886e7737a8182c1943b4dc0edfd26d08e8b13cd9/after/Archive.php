/**
 * Archiving process
 *
 *
 * Requirements
 *
 * + needs powerful and easy date handling => Zend_Date
 * + Needs many date helper functions
 * 		from a day, gives the week + list of the days in the week
 * 		from a day, gives the month + list of the days in the month
 * 		from a day, gives the year + list of the days in the year + list of the months in the year
 * - Contact with DB abstracted from the archive process
 * - Handle multi periods: day, week, month, year
 * - Each period logic is separated into different classes
 *   so that we can in the future easily add new weird periods
 * - support for partial archive (today's archive for example, but not limited to today)
 *
 * 	Features:
 * - delete logs once used for days
 *   it means that we have to keep the useful information for months/week etc.
 *   check also that the logging process doesn't use the logs we are deleting
 *
 *
 * Architecture
 * - *ArchiveProcessing* entity : handle all the computation on an archive / create & delete archive
 * - *Archive* entity:
 * 		contains the information on an archive,
 * 		uses the ArchiveProcessing if necessary
 * 		small overhead so we can instanciate many objects of this class for example one for each day
 * 			of the month
 * - *Website* entity: getId, getUrls, getFirstDay, etc.
 * + *Period* entity: composed of *Date* objects
 * + *Table* entity: serialize, unserialize, sort elements, limit number of elements
 * 		contains all the logic, data structure, etc.
 * 		receives data directly from the sql query via a known API
 * - The *ArchiveProcessing* saves in the DB *numbers* or *Table* objects
 *
