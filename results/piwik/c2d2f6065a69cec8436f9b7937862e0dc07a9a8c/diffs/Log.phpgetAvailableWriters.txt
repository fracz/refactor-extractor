         * This event is called when the Log instance is created. Plugins can use this event to
         * make new logging writers available.
         *
         * A logging writer is a callback with the following signature:
         *
         *     function (int $level, string $tag, string $datetime, string $message)
         *
         * `$level` is the log level to use, `$tag` is the log tag used, `$datetime` is the date time
         * of the logging call and `$message` is the formatted log message.
         *
         * Logging writers must be associated by name in the array passed to event handlers. The
         * name specified can be used in Piwik's INI configuration.
         *
         * **Example**
         *
         *     public function getAvailableWriters(&$writers) {
         *         $writers['myloggername'] = function ($level, $tag, $datetime, $message) {
         *             // ...
         *         };
         *     }
         *
         *     // 'myloggername' can now be used in the log_writers config option.
         *
         * @param array $writers Array mapping writer names with logging writers.
