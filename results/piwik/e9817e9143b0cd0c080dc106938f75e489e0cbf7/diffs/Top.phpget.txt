             * This event is triggered to collect all available menu items that should be displayed on the very top next
             * to login/logout, API and other menu items. Subscribe to this event if you want to add one or more items.
             * It's fairly easy. Just define the name of your menu item as well as a controller and an action that
             * should be executed once a user selects your menu item. It is also possible to display the item only for
             * users having a specific role.
             *
             * Example:
             * ```
             * public function addMenuItems()
             * {
             *     Piwik_AddTopMenu(
             *         'TopMenuName',
             *         array('module' => 'MyPlugin', 'action' => 'index'),
             *         Piwik::isUserIsSuperUser(),
             *         $order = 6
             *     );
