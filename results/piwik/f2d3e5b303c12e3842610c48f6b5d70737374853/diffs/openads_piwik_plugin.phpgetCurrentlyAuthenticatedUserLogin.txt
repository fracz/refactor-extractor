	 *
	 * If we don't find the files we display a nice message explaining what to do to the users
	 * - We tell them where to download the package with the openads plugin
	 * - Once they have uploaded the package on this server,
	 *   they give us the path to the package.
	 * - We save this path in the openads configuration file
	 * - We redirect to this same page so it checks if now the files are available
