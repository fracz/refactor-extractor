  /**
     * Load a string of YAML into a PHP array statically
     *
     * The load method, when supplied with a YAML string, will do its best
     * to convert YAML in a string into a PHP array.  Pretty simple.
     *
     * Note: use this function if you don't want files from the file system
     * loaded and processed as YAML.  This is of interest to people concerned
     * about security whose input is from a string.
     *
     *  Usage:
     *  <code>
     *   $array = Spyc::YAMLLoadString("---\n0: hello world\n");
     *   print_r($array);
     *  </code>
     * @access public
     * @return array
     * @param string $input String containing YAML
