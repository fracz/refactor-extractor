/*
 * Escaping input

	/**
	 * Returns the variable after cleaning operations.
	 * NB: The variable still has to be escaped before going into a SQL Query!
	 *
	 * If an array is passed the cleaning is done recursively on all the sub-arrays.
	 * The array's keys are filtered as well!
	 *
	 * How this method works:
	 * - The variable returned has been htmlspecialchars to avoid the XSS security problem.
	 * - The single quotes are not protected so "Piwik's amazing" will still be "Piwik's amazing".
	 *
	 * - Transformations are:
	 * 		- '&' (ampersand) becomes '&amp;'
	 *  	- '"'(double quote) becomes '&quot;'
	 * 		- '<' (less than) becomes '&lt;'
	 * 		- '>' (greater than) becomes '&gt;'
	 * - It handles the magic_quotes setting.
	 * - A non string value is returned without modification
	 *
	 * @param mixed The variable to be cleaned
	 * @return mixed The variable after cleaning
