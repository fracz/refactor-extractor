    Fixes #306
    - Adds new columns to the existing Pages report: Bounce rate, Average time on page, Exit rate
    - Adds new report: Entry pages
    - Adds new report: Exit pages
    - Adding table column inline help (on hover). Note: I don't think my metrics definitions are the best, they can be improved. anyone?
    I tried to add this icon: http://cdn.iconfinder.net/data/icons/uidesignicons/information.png but couldn't manage to make it look pretty (icon was either not positionned properly, or when it was positionned properly, it would appear in the dashboard even for columns that are hidden - the icon appeared out of nowhere..)
