        // FIXME: This is a quick fix for #3482. The actual cause of the bug is that
        // the site search & performance metrics additions to
        // ArchivingHelper::updateActionsTableWithRowQuery expect every
        // row to have 'type' data, but not all of the SQL queries that are run w/o
        // ranking query join on the log_action table and thus do not select the
        // log_action.type column.
        //
        // NOTES: Archiving logic can be generalized as follows:
        // 0) Do SQL query over log_link_visit_action & join on log_action to select
        //    some metrics (like visits, hits, etc.)
        // 1) For each row, cache the action row & metrics. (This is done by
        //    updateActionsTableWithRowQuery for result set rows that have
        //    name & type columns.)
        // 2) Do other SQL queries for metrics we can't put in the first query (like
        //    entry visits, exit vists, etc.) w/o joining log_action.
        // 3) For each row, find the cached row by idaction & add the new metrics to
        //    it. (This is done by updateActionsTableWithRowQuery for result set rows
        //    that DO NOT have name & type columns.)
        //
        // The site search & performance metrics additions expect a 'type' all the time
        // which breaks the original pre-rankingquery logic. Ranking query requires a
        // join, so the bug is only seen when ranking query is disabled.
