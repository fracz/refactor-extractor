	/**
	 * Serve static files through php proxy.
	 *
	 * It performs the following actions:
	 * 	- Checks the file is readable or returns "HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found"
	 *  - Returns "HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified" after comparing the HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE
	 *	  with the modification date of the static file
	 *	- Will try to compress the static file according to HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING. Compressed files are store in
	 *	  the /tmp directory. If compressing extensions are not available, a manually gzip compressed file
	 *	  can be provided in the /tmp directory. It has to bear the same name with an added .gz extension.
	 *	  Using manually compressed static files requires you to manually update the compressed file when
	 *	  the static file is updated.
	 *	- Overrides server cache control config to allow caching
	 *	- Sends Very Accept-Encoding to tell proxies to store different version of the static file according
	 *	  to users encoding capacities.
	 *
	 * Warning:
	 * 		Compressed filed are stored in the /tmp directory.
	 * 		If this method is used with two files bearing the same name but located in different locations,
	 * 		there is a risk of conflict. One file could be served with the content of the other.
	 * 		A future upgrade of this method would be to recreate the directory structure of the static file
	 * 		within a /tmp/compressed-static-files directory.
	 *
	 * @param string $file The location of the static file to serve
	 * @param string $contentType The content type of the static file.
