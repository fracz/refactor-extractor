    /**
	 * Deletes old archived data (reports & metrics).
	 *
	 * Archive tables are not optimized after, as that is handled by a separate scheduled task
	 * in CoreAdminHome. This is a scheduled task and will only execute every N days. The number
     * of days is determined by the delete_logs_schedule_lowest_interval config option.
     *
     * If delete_reports_enable is set to 1, old archive data is deleted. The following
     * config options can tweak this behavior:
     * - delete_reports_older_than: The number of months after which archive data is considered
     *                              old. The current month is not considered when applying this
     *                              value.
     * - delete_reports_keep_basic_metrics: If set to 1, keeps certain metric data. Right now,
     *                                      all metric data is kept.
     * - delete_reports_keep_day_reports: If set to 1, keeps old daily reports.
     * - delete_reports_keep_week_reports: If set to 1, keeps old weekly reports.
     * - delete_reports_keep_month_reports: If set to 1, keeps old monthly reports.
     * - delete_reports_keep_year_reports: If set to 1, keeps old yearly reports.
