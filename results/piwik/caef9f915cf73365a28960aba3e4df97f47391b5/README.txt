    Refs #4041, #4077, started refactoring of series picker JavaScript so it can be used by more than just jqPlot graphs.

    Notes:
      - Added new 'after_data_loaded_functions' view property that executes callbacks after data is loaded. Different from filters since it will be only executed once per data table.
      - Moved row picker view properties to Graph datatable visualization.
      - Refactored jqplot data generation so selectable columns & rows are dealt w/ in Graph datatable visualization instead of a JqplotDataGenerator instance.
      - Rewrote series picker to use dataTable client side properties instead of data generated by JqplotDataGenerator.
      - Fixed jqplock typo.
