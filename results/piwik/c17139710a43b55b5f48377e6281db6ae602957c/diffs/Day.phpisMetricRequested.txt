     * Returns the actions by the given dimension
     *
     * - The basic use case is to use $dimensionRecord and optionally $where.
     * - If you want to apply a limit and group the others, use $orderBy to sort the way you
     *   want the limit to be applied and pass a pre-configured instance of Piwik_RankingQuery.
     *   The ranking query instance has to have a limit and at least one label column.
     *   See Piwik_RankingQuery::setLimit() and Piwik_RankingQuery::addLabelColumn().
     *   If $rankingQuery is set, the return value is the array returned by
     *   Piwik_RankingQuery::execute().
     * - By default, the method only queries log_link_visit_action. If you need data from
     *   log_action (e.g. to partition the result from the ranking query into the different
     *   action types), use $joinLogActionOnColumn and $additionalSelects to join log_action and select
     *   the column you need from log_action.
     *
     *
     * @param array|string $dimensions      the dimensionRecord(s) you're interested in
     * @param string $where      where clause
     * @param bool|string $additionalSelects  additional select clause
     * @param bool|array $metrics    Set this if you want to limit the columns that are returned.
     *                                  The possible values in the array are Piwik_Archive::INDEX_*.
     * @param Piwik_RankingQuery $rankingQuery     pre-configured ranking query instance
     * @param bool|string $joinLogActionOnColumn  column from log_link_visit_action that
     *                                              log_action should be joined on.
     *                                                can be an array to join multiple times.
