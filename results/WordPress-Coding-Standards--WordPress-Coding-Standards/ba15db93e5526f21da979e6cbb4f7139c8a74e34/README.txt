    Move validation logic to a method

    This makes it available to all sniffs. We also move another method to
    the main sniff from the ValidatedSantizedInput sniff.

    In addition, Iâ€™ve refactored the sanitization portion of this sniff to
    use the `is_sanitized()` method that I recently introduced.
