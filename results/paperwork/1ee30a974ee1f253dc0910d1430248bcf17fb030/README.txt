    continuation on #282, refactoring notebook sidebar

    I used the angular-ui-bootstrap collapse directive to replace the bootstrap-tree.js code. I did not remove the bootstrap-tree.js from the repository, however il commented the corresponding line in the gulpfile, so that it is not used anymore.
