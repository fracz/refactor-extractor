    /**
     * Get a client by name using an array of constructor options.
     *
     * - api_provider: (callable) An optional PHP callable that accepts a
     *   type, service, and version argument, and returns an
     *   array of corresponding configuration data. The type
     *   value can be one of api, waiter, or paginator.
     * - class_name: (string, default=string(13) "Aws\AwsClient") Optional
     *   class name of the client to create. This value will be
     *   supplied by default.
     * - client: (GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface|bool, default=bool(true))
     *   Optional Guzzle client used to transfer requests over
     *   the wire. Set to true or do not specify a client, and
     *   the SDK will create a new client that uses a shared
     *   Ring HTTP handler with other clients.
     * - client_defaults: (array) Set to an array of Guzzle client request
     *   options (e.g., proxy, verify, etc.). See
     *   http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/clients.html#request-options
     *   for a list of available options.
     * - credentials: (array|Aws\Credentials\CredentialsInterface|bool|callable, default=bool(true))
     *   An Aws\Credentials\CredentialsInterface object to use
     *   with each, an associative array of "key", "secret",
     *   and "token" key value pairs, `false` to utilize null
     *   credentials, or a callable credentials provider
     *   function to create credentials using a function. If no
     *   credentials are provided or credentials is set to
     *   true, the SDK will attempt to load them from the
     *   environment.
     * - debug: (bool|resource) Set to true to display debug
     *   information when sending requests. Provide a stream
     *   resource to write debug information to a specific
     *   resource.
     * - defaults: (array) An associative array of default parameters to
     *   pass to each operation created by the client.
     * - endpoint: (string) The full URI of the webservice. This is only
     *   required when connecting to a custom endpoint (e.g., a
     *   local version of S3).
     * - endpoint_provider: (callable) An optional PHP callable that accepts a
     *   hash of options including a service and region key and
     *   returns a hash of endpoint data, of which the endpoint
     *   key is required.
     * - exception_class: (string, default=string(26)
     *   "Aws\Exception\AwsException") Optional exception class
     *   name to throw on request errors. This value will be
     *   supplied by default.
     * - profile: (string) Allows you to specify which profile to use
     *   when credentials are created from the AWS credentials
     *   file in your home directory. This setting overrides
     *   the AWS_PROFILE environment variable. Specifying
     *   "profile" will cause the "credentials" key to be
     *   ignored.
     * - region: (string, required) Region to connect to. See
     *   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html
     *   for a list of available regions.
     * - retries: (bool|int, default=bool(true)) Configures retries for
     *   clients. The value can be true (the default setting
     *   which enables retry behavior), false to disable
     *   retries, or a number representing the maximum number
     *   of retries.
     * - ringphp_handler: (callable) RingPHP handler used to transfer HTTP
     *   requests (see http://ringphp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
     * - scheme: (string, default=string(5) "https") URI scheme to use
     *   to connect. One of http or https.
     * - service: (string, required) Name of the service to utilize.
     *   This value will be supplied by default.
     * - signature: (string|Aws\Signature\SignatureInterface|bool,
     *   default=bool(false)) A string representing a custom
     *   signature version to use with a service (e.g., v4, s3,
     *   v2) or a Aws\Signature\SignatureInterface object. Set
     *   to false or do not specify a signature to use the
     *   default signature version of the service.
     * - validate: (bool, default=bool(true)) Set to false to disable
     *   client-side parameter validation.
     * - version: (string, required) The version of the webservice to
     *   utilize (e.g., 2006-03-01).
     *
     * @param string $name Client name
     * @param array  $args Custom arguments to provide to the client.
     *
     * @return AwsClientInterface
     * @throws \InvalidArgumentException
