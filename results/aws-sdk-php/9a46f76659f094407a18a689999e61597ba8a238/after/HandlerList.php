/**
 * Builds a single handler function from zero or more middleware functions and
 * an HTTP handler. The handler function is then used to send command objects
 * and return a promise that is resolved with an AWS result object.
 *
 * The "front" of the list is invoked before the "end" of the list. You can add
 * middleware to the front of the list using the "prepend" method, and the end
 * of the list using the "append" method. The last function invoked in a
 * handler list is the HTTP handler (a function that does not accept a next
 * handler but rather is responsible for returning a promise that is fulfilled
 * with a PSR-7 response object).
 *
 * Handlers can be ordered using a "step" that describes the step at which the
 * SDK is when sending a command. The available steps are:
 *
 * - init: The command is being initialized, allowing you to do things like add
 *   default options.
 * - validate: The command is being validated before it is serialized
 * - build: The command is being serialized into an HTTP request. A middleware
 *   in this step MUST serialize an HTTP request and populate the "@request"
 *   parameter of a command with the request such that it is available to
 *   subsequent middleware.
 * - sign: The request is being signed and prepared to be sent over the wire.
 *
 * You can control if a middleware is added to the front or end of a specific
 * step or the entire list by setting the "sticky" option to true when calling
 * the prepend or append method.
