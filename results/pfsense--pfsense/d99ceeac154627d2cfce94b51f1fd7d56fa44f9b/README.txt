    UI improvement - src port button label and src port help msgs

    1. Rename "srcportadv" to "srcporttoggle" - not ideal to have 2 fields both labelled "advanced options". This presentation probably works nicer
    2. Self-explanatory show/hide button itself doesn't need a label. (If srcports are shown, they will have a label as usual)
    2. Move explanatory text about src port normally being un-needed to below src port, and simplify main help msgs.

    Mainly GUI text/labels improvement
