    Instagram: setAnonymousUser() for non authenticated requests

    Some functions like the ones related to registration, are non
    authenticated requests, therefore to emulate this process in the API we
    can create a fictitious username that will make the trick.

    It will only send the pre login flow to obtain the csrftoken and the
    you can use functions like checkUsername() or checkEmail().

    This fictitious user is ONLY to make non authenticated requests as the
    ones found in Requests/Registration

    Iâ€™ll improve this when i have some spare time.
