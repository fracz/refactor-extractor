     * They don't actually mark any stories as "seen", so the user doesn't know
     * that you've seen their story. Actually marking the story as "seen" is
     * done via this endpoint instead. The official app calls this endpoint
     * periodically (with 1 or more items at a time) while watching a story.
     *
     * Tip: You can pass in the whole "getItems()" array from a user's story
     * feed (retrieved via any of the other story endpoints), to easily mark
     * all of that user's story media items as seen.
