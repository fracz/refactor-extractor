     * Dump YAML from PHP array statically
     *
     * The dump method, when supplied with an array, will do its best
     * to convert the array into friendly YAML.  Pretty simple.  Feel free to
     * save the returned string as nothing.yaml and pass it around.
     *
     * Oh, and you can decide how big the indent is and what the wordwrap
     * for folding is.  Pretty cool -- just pass in 'false' for either if
     * you want to use the default.
     *
     * Indent's default is 2 spaces, wordwrap's default is 40 characters.  And
     * you can turn off wordwrap by passing in 0.
     *
     * @access public
     * @return string
     * @param array $array PHP array
     * @param int $indent Pass in false to use the default, which is 2
     * @param int $wordwrap Pass in 0 for no wordwrap, false for default (40)
     * @param int $no_opening_dashes Do not start YAML file with "---\n"
