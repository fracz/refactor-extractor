	 * The default implementation will try to return the fixture data by including the external file specified by [[dataFile]].
	 * The file should return an array of data rows (column name => column value), each corresponding to a row in the table.
	 *
	 * If the data file does not exist, an empty array will be returned.
	 *
	 * @return array the data rows to be inserted into the database table.
