	 * Builds and executes a SQL statement for changing the definition of a column.
	 * @param string $table the table whose column is to be changed. The table name will be properly quoted by the method.
	 * @param string $column the name of the column to be changed. The name will be properly quoted by the method.
	 * @param string $type the new column type. The [[getColumnType()]] method will be invoked to convert abstract column type (if any)
	 * into the physical one. Anything that is not recognized as abstract type will be kept in the generated SQL.
	 * For example, 'string' will be turned into 'varchar(255)', while 'string not null' will become 'varchar(255) not null'.
