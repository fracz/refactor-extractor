	 *
	 * - Remove existing rows in the table.
	 * - If there is any auto-incremental column, the corresponding sequence will be reset to 0.
	 * - If a fixture file is found, it will be executed, and its return value will be treated
	 *   as rows which will then be inserted into the table.
	 *
	 * @param string $tableName table name
	 * @return array|boolean the loaded fixture rows indexed by row aliases (if any).
	 * False is returned if the table does not have a fixture.
	 * @throws InvalidConfigException if the specified table does not exist
