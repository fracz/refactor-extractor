	/**
	 * Saves the current record.
	 *
	 * This method will call [[insert()]] when [[isNewRecord]] is true, or [[update()]]
	 * when [[isNewRecord]] is false.
	 *
	 * For example, to save an article record:
	 *
	 * ~~~
	 * $customer = new Article;  // or $customer = Article::find(['id' => $id]);
	 * $customer->id = $id;
	 * $customer->genre_id = $genreId;
	 * $customer->content = $email;
	 * $customer->save();
	 * ~~~
	 *
	 *
	 * @param boolean $runValidation whether to perform validation before saving the record.
	 * If the validation fails, the record will not be saved.
	 * @param array $attributes list of attributes that need to be saved. Defaults to null,
	 * meaning all attributes that are loaded from index will be saved.
	 * @return boolean whether the saving succeeds
