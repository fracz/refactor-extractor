	 * Checks whether a specified key exists in the cache.
	 * This can be faster than getting the value from the cache if the data is big.
	 * Note that this method does not check whether the dependency associated
	 * with the cached data, if there is any, has changed. So a call to [[get]]
	 * may return false while exists returns true.
	 * @param mixed $key a key identifying the cached value. This can be a simple string or
	 * a complex data structure consisting of factors representing the key.
	 * @return boolean true if a value exists in cache, false if the value is not in the cache or expired.
