	 * and [[enableAutoLogin]] is true, it will also send out an identity
	 * cookie to support cookie-based login.
	 *
	 * @param Identity $identity the user identity (which should already be authenticated)
	 * @param integer $duration number of seconds that the user can remain in logged-in status.
	 * Defaults to 0, meaning login till the user closes the browser or the session is manually destroyed.
	 * If greater than 0 and [[enableAutoLogin]] is true, cookie-based login will be supported.
	 * @return boolean whether the user is logged in
