	 * Renders a view.
	 *
	 * The method first finds the actual view file corresponding to the specified view.
	 * It then calls [[renderFile()]] to render the view file. The rendering result is returned
	 * as a string. If the view file does not exist, an exception will be thrown.
	 *
	 * @param string $view the view to be rendered. Please refer to [[findViewFile()]] on possible formats of the view name.
	 * @param array $params the parameters that should be made available in the view. The PHP function `extract()`
	 * will be called on this variable to extract the variables from this parameter.
	 * @return string the rendering result
	 * @throws InvalidParamException if the view file cannot be found
	 * @see findViewFile()
