	/**
	 * Renders a view file under a context with an optional layout.
	 *
	 * This method is similar to [[renderFile()]] except that it will update [[context]]
	 * with the provided $context parameter. It will also apply layout to the rendering result
	 * of the view file if $layoutFile is given.
	 *
	 * Theming and localization will be performed for the view file and the layout file, if possible.
	 *
	 * @param object $context the context object for rendering the file. This could be a controller, a widget,
	 * or any other object that serves as the rendering context of the view file. In the view file,
	 * it can be accessed through the [[context]] property.
	 * @param string $viewFile the view file. This can be a file path or a path alias.
	 * @param array $params the parameters (name-value pairs) that will be extracted and made available in the view file.
	 * @param string|boolean $layoutFile the layout file. This can be a file path or a path alias.
	 * If it is false, it means no layout should be applied.
	 * @return string the rendering result
	 * @throws InvalidParamException if the view file or the layout file does not exist.
