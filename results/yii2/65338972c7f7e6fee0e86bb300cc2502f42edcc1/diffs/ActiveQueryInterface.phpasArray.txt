	/**
	 * Specifies the relations with which this query should be performed.
	 *
	 * The parameters to this method can be either one or multiple strings, or a single array
	 * of relation names and the optional callbacks to customize the relations.
	 *
	 * A relation name can refer to a relation defined in [[modelClass]]
	 * or a sub-relation that stands for a relation of a related record.
	 * For example, `orders.address` means the `address` relation defined
	 * in the model class corresponding to the `orders` relation.
	 *
	 * The followings are some usage examples:
	 *
	 * ~~~
	 * // find customers together with their orders and country
	 * Customer::find()->with('orders', 'country')->all();
	 * // find customers together with their orders and the orders' shipping address
	 * Customer::find()->with('orders.address')->all();
	 * // find customers together with their country and orders of status 1
	 * Customer::find()->with([
	 *     'orders' => function($query) {
	 *         $query->andWhere('status = 1');
	 *     },
	 *     'country',
	 * ])->all();
	 * ~~~
	 *
	 * @return static the query object itself
