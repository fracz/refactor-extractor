     * Copies a whole directory as another one.
     * The files and sub-directories will also be copied over.
     * @param string $src the source directory
     * @param string $dst the destination directory
     * @param array $options options for directory copy. Valid options are:
     *
     * - dirMode: integer, the permission to be set for newly copied directories. Defaults to 0775.
     * - fileMode:  integer, the permission to be set for newly copied files. Defaults to the current environment setting.
     * - filter: callback, a PHP callback that is called for each directory or file.
     *   The signature of the callback should be: `function ($path)`, where `$path` refers the full path to be filtered.
     *   The callback can return one of the following values:
     *
     *   * true: the directory or file will be copied (the "only" and "except" options will be ignored)
     *   * false: the directory or file will NOT be copied (the "only" and "except" options will be ignored)
     *   * null: the "only" and "except" options will determine whether the directory or file should be copied
     *
     * - only: array, list of patterns that the file paths should match if they want to be copied.
     *   A path matches a pattern if it contains the pattern string at its end.
     *   For example, '.php' matches all file paths ending with '.php'.
     *   Note, the '/' characters in a pattern matches both '/' and '\' in the paths.
     *   If a file path matches a pattern in both "only" and "except", it will NOT be copied.
     * - except: array, list of patterns that the files or directories should match if they want to be excluded from being copied.
     *   A path matches a pattern if it contains the pattern string at its end.
     *   Patterns ending with '/' apply to directory paths only, and patterns not ending with '/'
     *   apply to file paths only. For example, '/a/b' matches all file paths ending with '/a/b';
     *   and '.svn/' matches directory paths ending with '.svn'. Note, the '/' characters in a pattern matches
     *   both '/' and '\' in the paths.
     * - recursive: boolean, whether the files under the subdirectories should also be copied. Defaults to true.
     * - beforeCopy: callback, a PHP callback that is called before copying each sub-directory or file.
     *   If the callback returns false, the copy operation for the sub-directory or file will be cancelled.
     *   The signature of the callback should be: `function ($from, $to)`, where `$from` is the sub-directory or
     *   file to be copied from, while `$to` is the copy target.
     * - afterCopy: callback, a PHP callback that is called after each sub-directory or file is successfully copied.
     *   The signature of the callback should be: `function ($from, $to)`, where `$from` is the sub-directory or
     *   file copied from, while `$to` is the copy target.
     * @throws \yii\base\InvalidParamException if unable to open directory
