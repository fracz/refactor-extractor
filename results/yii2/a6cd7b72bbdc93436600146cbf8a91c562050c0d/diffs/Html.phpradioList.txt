	 * Generates an unordered list.
	 * @param array|\Traversable $items the items for generating the list. Each item generates a single list item.
	 * Note that items will be automatically HTML encoded if `$options['encode']` is not set or true.
	 * @param array $options options (name => config) for the radio button list. The following options are supported:
	 *
	 * - encode: boolean, whether to HTML-encode the items. Defaults to true.
	 *   This option is ignored if the `item` option is specified.
	 * - itemOptions: array, the HTML attributes for the `li` tags. This option is ignored if the `item` option is specified.
	 * - item: callable, a callback that is used to generate each individual list item.
	 *   The signature of this callback must be:
	 *
	 * ~~~
	 * function ($item, $index)
	 * ~~~
	 *
	 * where $index is the array key corresponding to `$item` in `$items`. The callback should return
	 * the whole list item tag.
	 *
	 * @return string the generated unordered list. An empty string is returned if `$items` is empty.
