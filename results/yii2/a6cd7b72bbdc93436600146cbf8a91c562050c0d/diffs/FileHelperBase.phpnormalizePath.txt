	 * The searching is based on the specified language code. In particular,

	 * whose name is the same as the language code. For example, given the file "path/to/view.php"
	 * and language code "zh_CN", the localized file will be looked for as
	 * "path/to/zh_CN/view.php". If the file is not found, the original file
	 * will be returned.
	 *
	 * If the target and the source language codes are the same,
	 * the original file will be returned.
	 *
	 * @param string $file the original file
	 * @param string $language the target language that the file should be localized to.
	 * If not set, the value of [[\yii\base\Application::language]] will be used.
	 * @param string $sourceLanguage the language that the original file is in.
	 * If not set, the value of [[\yii\base\Application::sourceLanguage]] will be used.
	 * @return string the matching localized file, or the original file if the localized version is not found.
	 * If the target and the source language codes are the same, the original file will be returned.
