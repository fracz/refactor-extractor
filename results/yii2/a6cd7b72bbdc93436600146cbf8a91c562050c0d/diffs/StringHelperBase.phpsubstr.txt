	/**
	 * Returns the trailing name component of a path.
	 * This method does the same as the php function `basename()` except that it will
	 * always use \ and / as directory separators, independent of the operating system.
	 * This method was mainly created to work on php namespaces. When working with real
	 * file paths, php's `basename()` should work fine for you.
	 * Note: this method is not aware of the actual filesystem, or path components such as "..".
	 * @param string $path A path string.
	 * @param string $suffix If the name component ends in suffix this will also be cut off.
	 * @return string the trailing name component of the given path.
	 * @see http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.basename.php
