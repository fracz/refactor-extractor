	/**
	 * Copies a whole directory as another one.
	 * The files and sub-directories will also be copied over.
	 * @param string $src the source directory
	 * @param string $dst the destination directory
	 * @param array $options options for directory copy. Valid options are:
	 *
	 * - dirMode: integer, the permission to be set for newly copied directories. Defaults to 0777.
	 * - fileMode:  integer, the permission to be set for newly copied files. Defaults to the current environment setting.
	 * - beforeCopy: callback, a PHP callback that is called before copying each sub-directory or file.
	 *   If the callback returns false, the copy operation for the sub-directory or file will be cancelled.
	 *   The signature of the callback should be: `function ($from, $to)`, where `$from` is the sub-directory or
 	 *   file to be copied from, while `$to` is the copy target.
	 * - afterCopy: callback, a PHP callback that is called after a sub-directory or file is successfully copied.
	 *   The signature of the callback is similar to that of `beforeCopy`.
