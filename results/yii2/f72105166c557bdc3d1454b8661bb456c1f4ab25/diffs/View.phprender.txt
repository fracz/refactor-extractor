	 * Renders a view file.
	 *
	 * If [[theme]] is enabled (not null), it will try to render the themed version of the view file as long
	 * as it is available.
	 *
	 * The method will call [[FileHelper::localize()]] to localize the view file.
	 *
	 * If [[renderer]] is enabled (not null), the method will use it to render the view file.
	 * Otherwise, it will simply include the view file as a normal PHP file, capture its output and
	 * return it as a string.
	 *
	 * @param string $viewFile the view file. This can be either a file path or a path alias.
	 * @param array $params the parameters (name-value pairs) that will be extracted and made available in the view file.
	 * @param object $context the context that the view should use for rendering the view. If null,
	 * existing [[context]] will be used.
	 * @return string the rendering result
	 * @throws InvalidParamException if the view file does not exist
