	/**
	 * Returns a list of behaviors that this component should behave as.
	 *
	 * Child classes may override this method to specify the behaviors they want to behave as.
	 *
	 * The return value of this method should be an array of behavior objects or configurations
	 * indexed by behavior names. A behavior configuration can be either a string specifying
	 * the behavior class or an array of the following structure:
	 *
	 * ~~~
	 * 'behaviorName' => array(
	 *     'class' => 'BehaviorClass',
	 *     'property1' => 'value1',
	 *     'property2' => 'value2',
	 * )
	 * ~~~
	 *
	 * Note that a behavior class must extend from [[Behavior]]. Behavior names can be strings
	 * or integers. If the former, they uniquely identify the behaviors. If the latter, the corresponding
	 * behaviors are anonymous and their properties and methods will NOT be made available via the component
	 * (however, the behaviors can still respond to the component's events).
	 *
	 * Behaviors declared in this method will be attached to the component automatically (on demand).
	 *
	 * @return array the behavior configurations.
