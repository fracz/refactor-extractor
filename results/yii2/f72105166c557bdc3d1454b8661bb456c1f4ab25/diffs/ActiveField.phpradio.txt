	/**
	 * Generates a checkbox tag for the given model attribute.
	 * This method will generate the "name" tag attribute automatically unless it is explicitly specified in `$options`.
	 * This method will generate the "checked" tag attribute according to the model attribute value.
	 * @param array $options the tag options in terms of name-value pairs. The following options are specially handled:
	 *
	 * - uncheck: string, the value associated with the uncheck state of the radio button. If not set,
	 *   it will take the default value '0'. This method will render a hidden input so that if the radio button
	 *   is not checked and is submitted, the value of this attribute will still be submitted to the server
	 *   via the hidden input.
	 *
	 * The rest of the options will be rendered as the attributes of the resulting tag. The values will
	 * be HTML-encoded using [[encode()]]. If a value is null, the corresponding attribute will not be rendered.
	 * @param boolean $enclosedByLabel whether to enclose the checkbox within the label.
	 * If true, the method will still use [[template]] to layout the checkbox and the error message
	 * except that the checkbox is enclosed by the label tag.
	 * @return string the generated checkbox tag
