	 * 'files[n]'..., and you can retrieve them all by passing 'files' as the name.
	 * @param string $name the name of the array of files
	 * @return UploadedFile[] the array of CUploadedFile objects. Empty array is returned
	 * if no adequate upload was found. Please note that this array will contain
	 * all files from all sub-arrays regardless how deeply nested they are.
