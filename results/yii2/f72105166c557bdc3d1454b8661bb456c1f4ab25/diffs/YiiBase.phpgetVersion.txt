	/**
	 * Imports a class by its alias.
	 *
	 * This method is provided to support autoloading of non-namespaced classes.
	 * Such a class can be specified in terms of an alias. For example, the alias `@old/code/Sample`
	 * may represent the `Sample` class under the directory `@old/code` (a path alias).
	 *
	 * By importing a class, the class is put in an internal storage such that when
	 * the class is used for the first time, the class autoloader will be able to
	 * find the corresponding class file and include it. For this reason, this method
	 * is much lighter than `include()`.
	 *
	 * You may import the same class multiple times. Only the first importing will count.
	 *
	 * @param string $alias the class to be imported. This may be either a class alias or a fully-qualified class name.
	 * If the latter, it will be returned back without change.
	 * @return string the actual class name that `$alias` refers to
	 * @throws Exception if the alias is invalid
