	 * Turns on query caching.

	 * with query caching: [[queryCacheDuration]] and [[queryCacheDependency]].
	 * @param integer $duration the number of seconds that query results may remain valid in cache.
	 * If not set, it will use the value of [[queryCacheDuration]]. See [[queryCacheDuration]] for more details.
	 * @param \yii\caching\Dependency $dependency the dependency for the cached query result.
	 * See [[queryCacheDependency]] for more details.
