	/**
	 * Redirects the browser to the specified URL.
	 * This method will send out a "Location" header to achieve the redirection.
	 * In AJAX mode, this normally will not work as expected unless there are some
	 * client-side JavaScript code handling the redirection. To help achieve this goal,
	 * this method will use [[ajaxRedirectCode]] as the HTTP status code when performing
	 * redirection in AJAX mode. The following JavaScript code may be used on the client
	 * side to handle the redirection response:
	 *
	 * ~~~
	 * $(document).ajaxSuccess(function(event, xhr, settings) {
	 *     if (xhr.status == 278) {
	 *         window.location = xhr.getResponseHeader('Location');
	 *     }
	 * });
	 * ~~~
	 *
	 * @param array|string $url the URL to be redirected to. [[\yii\helpers\Html::url()]]
	 * will be used to normalize the URL. If the resulting URL is still a relative URL
	 * (one without host info), the current request host info will be used.
	 * @param boolean $terminate whether to terminate the current application
	 * @param integer $statusCode the HTTP status code. Defaults to 302.
	 * See [[http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html]]
	 * for details about HTTP status code.
	 * Note that if the request is an AJAX request, [[ajaxRedirectCode]] will be used instead.
