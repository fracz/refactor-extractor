	/**
	 * Class autoload loader.
	 * This method is invoked automatically when PHP sees an unknown class.
	 * The method will attempt to include the class file according to the following procedure:
	 *
	 * 1. Search in [[classMap]];
	 * 2. If the class is namespaced (e.g. `yii\base\Component`), it will attempt
	 *    to include the file associated with the corresponding path alias
	 *    (e.g. `@yii/base/Component.php`);
	 * 3. If the class is named in PEAR style (e.g. `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase`),
	 *    it will attempt to include the file associated with the corresponding path alias
	 *    (e.g. `@PHPUnit/Framework/TestCase.php`);
	 * 4. Search PHP include_path for the actual class file if [[enableIncludePath]] is true;
	 * 5. Return false so that other autoloaders have chance to include the class file.
	 *
	 * @param string $className class name
	 * @return boolean whether the class has been loaded successfully
	 * @throws InvalidConfigException if the class file does not exist
	 * @throws UnknownClassException if the class does not exist in the class file
