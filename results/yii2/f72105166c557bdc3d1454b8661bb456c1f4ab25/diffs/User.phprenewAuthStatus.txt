	 * Performs access check for this user.
	 * @param string $operation the name of the operation that need access check.
	 * @param array $params name-value pairs that would be passed to business rules associated
	 * with the tasks and roles assigned to the user. A param with name 'userId' is added to
	 * this array, which holds the value of [[id]] when [[DbAuthManager]] or
	 * [[PhpAuthManager]] is used.
	 * @param boolean $allowCaching whether to allow caching the result of access check.
	 * When this parameter is true (default), if the access check of an operation was performed
	 * before, its result will be directly returned when calling this method to check the same
	 * operation. If this parameter is false, this method will always call
	 * [[AuthManager::checkAccess()]] to obtain the up-to-date access result. Note that this
	 * caching is effective only within the same request and only works when `$params = array()`.
	 * @return boolean whether the operations can be performed by this user.
