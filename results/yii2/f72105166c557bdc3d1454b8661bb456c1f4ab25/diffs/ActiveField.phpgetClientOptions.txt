	 * The options will be rendered as the attributes of the resulting tag. The values will be HTML-encoded

	 *

	 * - label: this specifies the label to be displayed. Note that this will NOT be [[encoded()]].
	 *   If this is not set, [[Model::getAttributeLabel()]] will be called to get the label for display
	 *   (after encoding).
