	/**
	 * Saves the current record.
	 *
	 * This method will call [[insert()]] when [[isNewRecord]] is true, or [[update()]]
	 * when [[isNewRecord]] is false.
	 *
	 * For example, to save a customer record:
	 *
	 * ~~~
	 * $customer = new Customer;  // or $customer = Customer::find($id);
	 * $customer->name = $name;
	 * $customer->email = $email;
	 * $customer->save();
	 * ~~~
	 *
	 *
	 * @param boolean $runValidation whether to perform validation before saving the record.
	 * If the validation fails, the record will not be saved to database.
	 * @param array $attributes list of attributes that need to be saved. Defaults to null,
	 * meaning all attributes that are loaded from DB will be saved.
	 * @return boolean whether the saving succeeds
