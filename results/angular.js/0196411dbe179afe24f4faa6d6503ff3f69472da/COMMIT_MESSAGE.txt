    refactor(scope.$watch): rearrange arguments passed into watcher (newValue, oldValue, scope)

    As scopes are injected into controllers now, you have the reference anyway, so having scope as first argument makes no senseâ€¦

    Breaks $watcher gets arguments in different order (newValue, oldValue, scope)
