    fix(ngInclude): $animate refactoring + use transclusion

    BREAKING CHANGE: previously ngInclude only updated its content, after this change
    ngInclude will recreate itself every time a new content is included. This ensures
    that a single rootElement for all the included contents always exists, which makes
    definition of css styles for animations much easier.
