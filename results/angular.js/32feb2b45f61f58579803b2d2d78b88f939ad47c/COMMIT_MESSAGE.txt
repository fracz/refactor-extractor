    refactor($compile): Create non-descriptive comments when debugInfoEnabled is false

    When debugInfoEnabled is `false` when comments generated by transclusions, ngIf,
    ngRepeat and ngSwitch will not contain any information about the directive nor
    the expression associated with it.

    Closes: #8722
