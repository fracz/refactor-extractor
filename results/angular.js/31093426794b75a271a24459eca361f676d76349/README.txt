    docs(guide/unit-testing): improve unit testing guide

    This commit adds to the unit testing guide:

    - an explicit section on additional libraries: Karma, Jasmine and
      angular-mocks and link to the docs for those projects too. Explain the
      benefit and use case for each of these libaries
    - fully featured test examples and add more documentation
      around them, in particular the controller test
    - a clear separation between the section on principles of testing
      and the actual tutorial on writing a test

    Closes #8220
