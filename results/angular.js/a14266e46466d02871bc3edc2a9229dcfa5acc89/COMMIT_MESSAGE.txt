    chore(CHANGELOG): introduce perf() section for performance-related commits

    Instead of using fix() or chore() when labelling a commit which improves
    speed or performance use perf(). Perf commits will be listed in the
    CHANGELOG under "Performance Improvements".

    For example:
    perf($animate): cache all getComputedStyle operations to reduce additional reflows
