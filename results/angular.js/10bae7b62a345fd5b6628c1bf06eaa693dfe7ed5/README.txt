    docs(guide/controller): improve guidance and examples

    Remove mention of global controller functions
    Convert larger examples to runnable demos
    Remove mention of pre-1.0 controllers, in particular discussion of
    controller inheritance.

    TODO: Probably could do with updating to explain the "controller as" syntax
    at some point.

    Closes: #4373
