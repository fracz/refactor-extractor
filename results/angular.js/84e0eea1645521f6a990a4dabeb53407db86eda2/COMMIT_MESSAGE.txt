    chore(docs): remove Disqus comments

    We don't actively moderate these comments, and they range from
    out of date, to inflammatory, to spam. Going forward, improvements
    to the docs should be done via a PR, and questions should go on
    StackOverflow where they can be curated and kept up to date by
    AngularJS developers who help out there.
