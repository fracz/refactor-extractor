    docs(tutorial/step-7): improve injector information

    I attempted to tighten up the language around the DI overview so that it was clearer
    and more explicit. The sole responsibilities sentence was semantically jarring and
    I think looks better as a list.  Some minor grammar improvements.

    Closes #7099
