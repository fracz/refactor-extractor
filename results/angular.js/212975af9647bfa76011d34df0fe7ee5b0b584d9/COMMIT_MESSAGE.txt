    docs(form): Add comma to line 319 for readability

    Line 319 is hard to read on the first glimpse.

    Currently the sentence reads:
    "In Angular forms can be nested"

    The sentence should read either
    "In Angular, forms can be nested"
    or
    "Forms can be nested in angular"

    I changed it to the former in this pull request.

    Closes #11271
