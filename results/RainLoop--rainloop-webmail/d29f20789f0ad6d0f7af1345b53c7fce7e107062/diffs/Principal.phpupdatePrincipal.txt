    /**
     * This method is used to search for principals matching a set of
     * properties.
     *
     * This search is specifically used by RFC3744's principal-property-search
     * REPORT. You should at least allow searching on
     * http://sabredav.org/ns}email-address.
     *
     * The actual search should be a unicode-non-case-sensitive search. The
     * keys in searchProperties are the WebDAV property names, while the values
     * are the property values to search on.
     *
     * If multiple properties are being searched on, the search should be
     * AND'ed.
     *
     * This method should simply return an array with full principal uri's.
     *
     * If somebody attempted to search on a property the backend does not
     * support, you should simply return 0 results.
     *
     * You can also just return 0 results if you choose to not support
     * searching at all, but keep in mind that this may stop certain features
     * from working.
     *
     * @param string $prefixPath
