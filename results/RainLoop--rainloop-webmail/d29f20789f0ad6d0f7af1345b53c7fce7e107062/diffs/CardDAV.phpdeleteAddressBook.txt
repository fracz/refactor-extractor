    /**
     * Returns all cards for a specific addressbook id.
     *
     * This method should return the following properties for each card:
     *   * carddata - raw vcard data
     *   * uri - Some unique url
     *   * lastmodified - A unix timestamp
     *
     * It's recommended to also return the following properties:
     *   * etag - A unique etag. This must change every time the card changes.
     *   * size - The size of the card in bytes.
     *
     * If these last two properties are provided, less time will be spent
     * calculating them. If they are specified, you can also ommit carddata.
     * This may speed up certain requests, especially with large cards.
     *
     * @param mixed $mAddressBookID
	 *
     * @return array
