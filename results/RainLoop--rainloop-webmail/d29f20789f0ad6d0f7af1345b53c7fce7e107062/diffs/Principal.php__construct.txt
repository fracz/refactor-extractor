     * You are expected to return at least a 'uri' for every user, you can
     * return any additional properties if you wish so. Common properties are:
     *   {DAV:}displayname
     *   {http://sabredav.org/ns}email-address - This is a custom SabreDAV
     *     field that's actually injected in a number of other properties. If
