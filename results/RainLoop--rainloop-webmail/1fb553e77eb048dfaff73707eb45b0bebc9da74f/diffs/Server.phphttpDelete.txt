     * WebDAV PROPFIND

     * This WebDAV method requests information about an uri resource, or a list of resources
     * If a client wants to receive the properties for a single resource it will add an HTTP Depth: header with a 0 value
     * If the value is 1, it means that it also expects a list of sub-resources (e.g.: files in a directory)
     *
     * The request body contains an XML data structure that has a list of properties the client understands
     * The response body is also an xml document, containing information about every uri resource and the requested properties
     *
     * It has to return a HTTP 207 Multi-status status code
     *
