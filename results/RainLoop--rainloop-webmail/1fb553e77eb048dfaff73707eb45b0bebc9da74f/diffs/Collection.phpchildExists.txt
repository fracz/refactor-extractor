     * Creates a new file in the directory

     * as a string. Keep in mind that you may have to support either.
     *
     * After succesful creation of the file, you may choose to return the ETag
     * of the new file here.
     *
     * The returned ETag must be surrounded by double-quotes (The quotes should
     * be part of the actual string).
     *
     * If you cannot accurately determine the ETag, you should not return it.
     * If you don't store the file exactly as-is (you're transforming it
     * somehow) you should also not return an ETag.
     *
     * This means that if a subsequent GET to this new file does not exactly
     * return the same contents of what was submitted here, you are strongly
     * recommended to omit the ETag.
