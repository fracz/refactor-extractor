     * Returns the HTTP Prefer header information.
     *
     * The prefer header is defined in:
     * http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-http-prefer-14
     *
     * This method will return an array with options.
     *
     * Currently, the following options may be returned:
     *   array(
     *      'return-asynch'         => true,
     *      'return-minimal'        => true,

     *      'wait'                  => 30,
     *      'strict'                => true,
     *      'lenient'               => true,
     *   )
     *
     * This method also supports the Brief header, and will also return
     * 'return-minimal' if the brief header was set to 't'.
     *
     * For the boolean options, false will be returned if the headers are not
     * specified. For the integer options it will be 'null'.
