     * This method is used to search for principals matching a set of

     * This search is specifically used by RFC3744's principal-property-search
     * REPORT. You should at least allow searching on
     * http://sabredav.org/ns}email-address.
     *
     * The actual search should be a unicode-non-case-sensitive search. The
     * keys in searchProperties are the WebDAV property names, while the values
     * are the property values to search on.
     *
     * If multiple properties are being searched on, the search should be
     * AND'ed.
     *
     * This method should simply return a list of 'child names', which may be
     * used to call $this->getChild in the future.
     *
