     * vcards). This means that if a property is grouped as "HOME.EMAIL", it
     * will also be returned when searching for just "EMAIL". If you want to
     * search for a property in a specific group, you can select on the entire
     * string ("HOME.EMAIL"). If you want to search on a specific property that
     * has not been assigned a group, specify ".EMAIL".
     *
     * Keys are retained from the 'children' array, which may be confusing in
     * certain cases.
